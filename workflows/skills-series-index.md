# Skills I Use Everyday - Master Index

Series of skill-based content posts shared on LinkedIn and X. Each post documents a real Cursor skill or system the creator uses daily — the skill file IS the context.

## Series Format

Posts follow: "skills I use everyday, part [n] ⚡"

Each post includes:
- The skill name and what it does
- Real example of the skill in action (screenshot optional)
- Comment thread with deeper how-to and framework reasoning
- P.S. kickoff (Part 1 only): "new series in the making. from GTM plays. and now /skills I use everyday. this is part One, [Skill Name] skill in action. don't sleep on the series if you're trying to learn tools like Cursor. lets build!"

## Active Skills (Canonized)

| # | Skill Name | Path | What It Covers |
|---|------------|------|----------------|
| 1 | Voice Modularity | `.cursor/skills` + `skills/tier-1-voice-dna/` | Write-with vs write-for, editing voice rules in real-time during content creation |
| 2 | Skill Play | `.cursor/skills/skill-play/SKILL.md` | Skill file → LinkedIn + X drafts. The command that creates posts about skills. Meta recursion. |
| 3 | Agent Context Handoff | `.cursor/skills/agent-context-handoff/SKILL.md` | Produces scope/handoff docs for new agent threads. Standalone, token-efficient, file-anchored. Meta: handoff → content about handoff. |

## Unnumbered (Future Candidates)

| Skill | Path | Potential Angle |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| play-draft | `.cursor/skills/play-draft/SKILL.md` | Screenshot → content draft workflow |
| final-copy | `.cursor/skills/final-copy/SKILL.md` | Draft → plain text + Typefully |
| image-to-content | `.cursor/skills/image-to-content/SKILL.md` | Image → LinkedIn + X drafts |
| value-pin-comments | `.cursor/skills/value-pin-comments/SKILL.md` | Value pin comment generation |
| slack-sync | `.cursor/skills/slack-sync/SKILL.md` | Partner channel sync |
| update-github | `.claude/skills/update-github/SKILL.md` | Pre-push safety scan |
| heyreach-partner-handoff | `.cursor/skills/heyreach-partner-handoff/SKILL.md` | HeyReach MCP → accepted/unaccepted → deep research → Contax handoff (Play 16, v2) |

## Relationship to GTM Plays

- **GTM Plays** = workflows running in production (Clay, HubSpot, MCP, automations). Screen recordings, step-by-step.
- **Skills I Use Everyday** = Cursor skills and system files. The skill file IS the source of truth. Use `/skill play <skill-name>` to draft.
- **v2 plays** (e.g., Play 16 HeyReach Partner Handoff) = MCP + Cursor orchestration, multi-workflow skills. Evolving from Clay-heavy; not replacing.

## Content Repurpose Potential

Each skill post can expand into:
- X thread (condensed version)
- Skill file as open-source / template for others
- Follow-up post when the skill gets updated
- Substack Tactical Breakdown or System Share essay via `/substackpost repurpose <path>` (see `workflows/substack-index.md`)
