# OS.AI Labs — Substack Post Index

Newsletter deep dives expanding on GTM plays, Cursor skills, and build logs. Evolved from the "Inside the Lab" Beehiiv era into OS.AI Labs on Substack.

## Series Evolution

**Old format (Beehiiv, Apr–May 2025)**: "Inside the Lab" volumes with custom AI-generated anime artwork. High production overhead. Signal-chaining, lead magnets, scoring systems.

**New format (Substack, Feb 2026+)**: "OS.AI Labs" (frontrunner name — final confirmation pending in Post 1 draft. Runner-ups: OS.AI, OS.AI Notes, OS.AI Log). Visuals from actual builds: Cursor screenshots, repo trees, Claude outputs, screen recordings. No separate art production step.

## Legacy Archive (Beehiiv → Substack Migration)

- X thread (3–5 tweets, key points only)
- Reddit post (tutorial/breakdown adapted for niche subreddits — see `skills/tier-3-content-ops/pillars/reddit-growth-seo.md`)

Each LinkedIn/X post can expand into:
