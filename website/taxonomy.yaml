# ── SEO Topology ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

seo_topology:
  parent_keyword: "building with AI"
  thesis: >
    All three sites are vertical specializations of one concept: building with AI.
    shawnos is the hub (the builder). gtmos is the GTM arm (building GTM with AI).
    contentos is the content arm (building content with AI). Each site builds
    domain authority in its niche while the cross-links and sameAs schema tell
    Google they're one connected entity by the same author.
  recursive_structure: >
    The act of building the system IS the content for shawnos.
    The GTM workflows produced by the system ARE the content for gtmos.
    The methodology of creating content with the system IS the content for contentos.
    Each site's content proves the other two sites' thesis.
