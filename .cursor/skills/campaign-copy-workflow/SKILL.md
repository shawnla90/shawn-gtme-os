# Campaign Copy Workflow

Generate a complete outbound email campaign package: static email bodies (for Instantly or HeyReach) plus a Clay-compatible personalization research prompt that embeds those bodies and produces merge variables that read naturally in context.

## Trigger

- `/campaigncopy <partner>` (e.g., `/campaigncopy praecipio`)
- "campaign copy workflow praecipio"
- "build campaign copy for [partner]"

## Prerequisites

The partner must already have Phase 1 research in place:
- `clients/partner/<partner>/research/icp.md` — target accounts, verticals, qualification criteria
- `clients/partner/<partner>/research/personas.md` — buyer tiers and titles
- `clients/partner/<partner>/prompts/signal-retrieval.md` — pain signals and enrichment signals

If any are missing, tell the user to run `/webreveal <partner>` or `/partneronboard <partner>` first.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Partner Context

Read these files to understand the partner's positioning, ICP, and pain signals:

```
clients/partner/<partner>/SKILL.md
clients/partner/<partner>/research/icp.md
clients/partner/<partner>/research/personas.md
clients/partner/<partner>/prompts/signal-retrieval.md
```

### Step 2: Confirm Campaign Parameters

Ask the user:
1. **Campaign type**: 2-message email (default), 3-email sequence, LinkedIn DM sequence, or custom
2. **Sending platform**: Instantly (default), HeyReach, or other
3. **Target persona tier**: Which tier(s) from personas.md to optimize for (default: primary outreach tiers)
4. **Sender name**: Who signs the emails (default: Shawn)
5. **Any specific angles or constraints**: e.g., "focus on cloud migration only" or "ServiceNow displacement angle"

### Step 3: Write Static Email Bodies

Create/overwrite `clients/partner/<partner>/prompts/campaign-copy.md` with:

1. **Header** with status, merge fields, variable source, and campaign metadata
2. **Each email** in a code block with subject line and body, containing merge field placeholders
3. **Copy notes** section documenting voice rules and variable sourcing

**Voice rules** (from `.cursor/skills/email-copy/SKILL.md`):
- Contractions, short sentences, fragments okay
- No spam triggers (leverage, synergize, cutting-edge, revolutionary, game-changer)
- No quotation marks around brand/service names
- Human tone — "Happy to send over" not "I would be pleased to furnish"
- No "Hope this finds you well" or generic openers

**Merge field convention**:
- `{first_name}`, `{company_name}` — from Clay enrichment data
- `{icebreaker}`, `{pain_point}` — generated by Clay research prompt
- Additional variables only if the campaign type requires them

**Email structure (2-message default)**:
- **Email 1 (Day 0)**: Opens with `{icebreaker}` — specific, personal. Then poke the bear — calls out a known-but-unspoken problem. Value offer up front (teardown, breakdown, or insight). CTA is a quick call, not passive.
- **Email 2 (Day 3)**: Brief callback. `{pain_point}` as standalone paragraph — company-specific observation. Light partner positioning (proof points). CTA is a quick call with low-risk framing.

### Step 4: Generate Body-Aware Research Prompt

Create/overwrite `clients/partner/<partner>/prompts/personalization-research.md` with a Clay-compatible prompt that:

1. **Embeds the full email body text** from Step 3 — so the AI understands exactly where each variable appears and crafts them to read naturally in context
2. **Includes partner service categories** and pain signals from the research files
3. **Defines strict rules** for each variable with good/bad examples
4. **Outputs JSON array** per prompt-formatting standard
5. **Places inputs at the bottom** per `.cursor/rules/prompt-formatting.md`

**Data hierarchy** — the prompt must instruct the AI to prioritize data sources in this order:
1. **LinkedIn profile** (about, headline, experience, skills) — best for icebreaker personalization
2. **Company domain / tech stack** — best for pain point signals
3. **Title + industry + size inference** — fallback only, flag confidence as Low

The agent searches the LinkedIn profile for personalization hooks. If the profile is thin, it falls back to domain-level signals. If domain gives nothing useful, it uses role-based inference and flags it for manual review.

**Prompt size discipline** — keep the prompt tight. Every section should earn its place:
- Service categories: one line each, no descriptions unless they add targeting value
- Pain signals: bullet list, no explanations — the AI knows what they mean in context
- Email bodies: include in full (non-negotiable — this is what makes variables fit naturally)
- Variable rules: brief, with 2-3 good examples. Skip bad examples if the good ones are clear enough
- No redundant instructions. If the data hierarchy section already says "don't fabricate," don't repeat it in the variable rules

The research prompt eats Clay's context window per contact. Shorter prompt = better output quality at scale.

**Critical**: The research prompt and email bodies must always be in sync. If you change a body, regenerate the research prompt so the embedded context matches.

### Step 5: Update Partner Skill Tree

After generating both files:

1. **Update `clients/partner/<partner>/SKILL.md`**:
   - Add `personalization-research.md` to the Prompts table if not present
   - Update `campaign-copy.md` description to reflect the actual campaign type

2. **Update `clients/partner/<partner>/workflows/campaign-patterns.md`**:
   - Register the new play in the Active Plays section with target persona, trigger, and status

### Step 6: Summary

Print a summary for the user:
- Files created/updated
- Merge fields used
- Next steps (paste bodies into Instantly, paste research prompt into Clay, connect Clay → Instantly sync)

## File Outputs

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `clients/partner/<partner>/prompts/campaign-copy.md` | Static email bodies with merge field placeholders — paste into sending platform |
| `clients/partner/<partner>/prompts/personalization-research.md` | Clay prompt — generates personalization variables that fit naturally into the bodies |

## Sync Rule

The two output files are a **coupled pair**. If either changes, the other must be regenerated. The research prompt embeds the email bodies as context — stale bodies in the prompt produce variables that don't flow in the actual emails.

When the user asks to update campaign copy, always regenerate both files.
