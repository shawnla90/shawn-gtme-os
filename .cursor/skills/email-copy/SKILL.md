# Email Copy

Apply this skill whenever writing email copy—cold outreach, follow-ups, sequences, or campaign touches—for any company or persona.

## Core Rules

### 1. Never Use Quotations Around Product/Service Names
- ❌ `quote the "switch to Acme"`
- ✅ `quote the switch to Acme`
Quotations around brand phrases look stiff and unnatural. Use plain text.

### 2. Spin Text — Never Duplicate Copy
When generating multiple emails (e.g., for a list or sequence), **vary every message**. Identical copy hurts deliverability and flags spam filters.

**Vary:**
- **Greetings**: Hey / Hi / [FirstName], (or lead with a different opener)
- **Phrasing**: Different ways to say the same thing
- **Sentence structure**: Vary length, rhythm, and order
- **Transition words**: Also / And / Plus / By the way

**Example spins for "who handles WiFi":**
- who on your team ensures WiFi is a good experience for residents
- who handles WiFi for residents
- who oversees resident connectivity
- who manages WiFi across your properties

### 3. Avoid AI / Spam Triggers
- **Overused words**: leverage, synergize, cutting-edge, revolutionary, game-changer
- **ALL CAPS** or excessive punctuation!!!
- **Pressure language**: act now, limited time, don't miss out
- **Too-perfect grammar**: Slightly casual, human imperfection is fine
- **Repetitive structures**: Vary paragraph length and rhythm

### 4. Sound Human
- Short sentences. Fragments okay.
- Contractions: I'd, we're, it's, you're
- Conversational tone: "Happy to send over" vs "I would be pleased to furnish"
- One idea per sentence when possible

## Spin Variation Checklist

When generating N emails, ensure:
- [ ] At least 3 different greetings used (Hey, Hi, [Name], etc.)
- [ ] No two emails share the exact same opening line
- [ ] CTA / core message rephrased in at least 2–3 ways
- [ ] Sign-offs or event hooks varied
- [ ] Overall structure (paragraph order, length) differs where possible

## Quick Reference: Greeting Alternatives

| Use | Avoid (overused) |
|-----|-------------------|
| Hey [Name], | Dear [Name], (cold) |
| Hi [Name], | Hello [Name], (formal) |
| [Name], (direct) | Hi there, (vague) |
| Quick one — | Hope this finds you well (AI tell) |

## Quick Reference: CTA Variations

For "quote the switch" type CTAs:
- I'd like to earn the opportunity to quote the switch to [Company]...
- Happy to quote the switch to [Company] if it's worth exploring
- We can quote the switch to [Company] — including any upgrades needed
- I'd love to quote the switch to [Company] for [X] units
- If it makes sense, we can quote the switch to [Company]

Rotate; never use the same formulation twice in a batch.

## Output

When writing copy:
1. Generate variations first (list 3–5 spins for key phrases)
2. Assign different spins to different recipients (deterministic by row/ID so it's reproducible)
3. Review: no duplicate openings, no spam triggers, natural tone
