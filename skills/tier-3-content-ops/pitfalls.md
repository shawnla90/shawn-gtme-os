# Common Pitfalls to Avoid

## The "Thought Leader" Trap

- Performing wisdom instead of sharing lessons
- Abstract principles without concrete examples
- Three perfect parallel examples
- Branding concepts instead of explaining them

## The "Generic Advice" Trap

- "Use data to make better decisions"
- "Focus on your ICP"
- "Optimize your CRM"

These are worthless without specifics. Always add: how, why, what exactly?

## The "Over-Polish" Trap

- Spending 4 hours on a post that should take 30 minutes
- Optimizing language instead of adding substance
- Making it "perfect" instead of shipping it

## The "Too Technical" Trap

- Using jargon without context
- Assuming everyone knows Clay/HubSpot deeply
- Skipping the "why this matters" framing

Balance: Be specific enough to be useful, accessible enough to be interesting.
