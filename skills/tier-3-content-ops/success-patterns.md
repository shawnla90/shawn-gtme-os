# Success Patterns From Your Best Content

## What Works

1. **Long tactical posts** (1000+ chars) with specific Clay/CRM implementations
2. **Behind-the-scenes** build processes with gotchas
3. **Anonymized client lessons** with real problems and solutions
4. **Pattern recognition** posts that name something others haven't
5. **Self-deprecating** builder humor (messy room post)

## What Doesn't Work

1. Short abstract advice without examples
2. Generic "here's a tip" posts
3. Over-polished corporate content
4. Posts without technical substance
5. Content that sounds like everyone else
