## zenos (future)

### zen-os

- **Title**: Zen Operating System -- AI Health and Lifestyle Blog
- **Domain**: zenos (future -- theZenOS.ai or similar)
- **Pillars**: Building and Sharing, new pillar (AI + Lifestyle)
- **Status**: parked
- **Description**: A 4th blog in the network focused on AI-powered health and lifestyle. Core voice inherited from the OS but adapted for wellness context. Integrates biometric data (Oura Ring, Apple Watch) for sleep, activity, and health tracking. A "Zen bot" that knows your age, biometrics, habits, and motivates while also generating content about AI in everyday life. Expands the recursive loop. the health system becomes the content becomes the system.
- **Related ideas**: three-domain-network, recursive-loop
- **Breadcrumb notes**: In current content, naturally reference "the system keeps expanding" or hint at health/lifestyle as the next frontier. Don't name it yet. tease the pattern of OS thinking applied beyond GTM.

### recursive-drift-method

- **Title**: Recursive Drift — The Non-Linear Method for Building With AI
- **Domain**: shawnos
- **Pillars**: Building and Sharing, Knowledge Engineering
- **Status**: incubating
- **Description**: A codified methodology for how Shawn builds with AI. Not a step-by-step framework — a state machine with recursive feedback. Six modes (Freefall, Plan, Build, Break, Ask, Seed) cycled in no fixed order, where each loop's output becomes the next loop's input. The build IS the content. Plans rewrite themselves during execution. Differentiator from linear methods: the recursive property and the non-linear state transitions. Terminal aesthetic shorthand: `recursive-drift --init`.
- **Related ideas**: zen-os, twitch-gaming-discord, recursive-loop
- **Breadcrumb notes**: Seeds already planned for Monday launch drafts and Hello World blog post. Subtle forward-references like "the way I build with AI isn't a framework. it's closer to structured freefall." and "plans rewrite themselves." Don't announce — tease. The `/recursive` concept page comes mid-week, `/method` page late-week, full content series next week.
- **Next phases**: (1) Internal definition doc at `skills/tier-1-voice-dna/method.md`, (2) Breadcrumb seeds in Monday drafts, (3) `/recursive` concept page, (4) `/method` page on shawnos.ai, (5) LinkedIn + Substack + X content series
- **Date captured**: 2026-02-16

### twitch-gaming-discord

- **Title**: Twitch Gaming + Discord Community Pillar
- **Domain**: shawnos
- **Pillars**: twitch-gaming-discord, building-sharing
- **Status**: parked
- **Description**: Hybrid Twitch streaming -- vibe coding with AI tools (Cursor, Claude Code) alongside gaming (Elden Ring, retro emulation, Souls-likes). Discord as the always-on community hub between streams. Clips feed the TikTok pipeline via Clipbot/Vizard automation. The computer build is the origin story, the stream is the next chapter. Activates post-computer-build. Differentiator: not a pure dev streamer, not a pure gamer. The hybrid format promotes AI through the gaming lens.
- **Related ideas**: zen-os, recursive-loop
- **Breadcrumb notes**: Reference "building the machine" or "the rig" in current content. Hint at "what happens when the build is done" without naming Twitch or Discord directly. The computer build narrative naturally sets up this pillar's activation.
- **Date captured**: 2026-02-13
