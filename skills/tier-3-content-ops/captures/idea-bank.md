## shawnos

### twitch-gaming-discord

- **Title**: Twitch Gaming + Discord Community Pillar
- **Domain**: shawnos
- **Pillars**: twitch-gaming-discord, building-sharing
- **Status**: parked
- **Description**: Hybrid Twitch streaming -- vibe coding with AI tools (Cursor, Claude Code) alongside gaming (Elden Ring, retro emulation, Souls-likes). Discord as the always-on community hub between streams. Clips feed the TikTok pipeline via Clipbot/Vizard automation. The computer build is the origin story, the stream is the next chapter. Activates post-computer-build. Differentiator: not a pure dev streamer, not a pure gamer. The hybrid format promotes AI through the gaming lens.
- **Related ideas**: zen-os, recursive-loop
- **Breadcrumb notes**: Reference "building the machine" or "the rig" in current content. Hint at "what happens when the build is done" without naming Twitch or Discord directly. The computer build narrative naturally sets up this pillar's activation.
- **Date captured**: 2026-02-13
