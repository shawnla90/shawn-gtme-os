# Content Pillar: X Micro-Tips

## Format

Short, tactical 2-part X posts. One post + one reply. No threads. No narratives. Just the tip and the expand.

## Structure

1. **Post**: The tip itself. Clear, opinionated, under 280 chars. Starts with a series marker like "cursor tip 101:" or "cursor tip:" followed by the rule/insight. Ends with a punchy closer (one-liner that makes people stop scrolling).
2. **Reply**: Expands the tip with the why or the how. Still tight. Ends with ⚡ only.

## Opener Pattern

- "cursor tip 101:" for the first series (Cursor-specific tips)
- Future series can use different prefixes: "mcp tip:", "agent tip:", "outbound tip:", etc.
- Always lowercase. The colon is the identifier.

## Real Examples

**Plan mode tip (Post):**
"cursor tip 101: if you don't have a slash command for it yet, start in plan mode. that's the rule."

**Plan mode tip (Reply):**
"plan mode means no files get touched. no accidental edits. no burned context on a half-baked approach. you get a clean blueprint. adjust it until it's right. then move execution to a fresh chat. small habit. massive difference. ⚡"

## What Makes This Pillar Work

- Fastest content to produce. One topic, two tweets, done.
- Each tip stands alone. no series arc needed, no continuation dependency.
- The reply adds depth without the post needing it. the post is the scroll-stopper, the reply is the payoff.
- Positions you as someone with a deep enough workflow to have tip-level patterns.
- Easy to batch. write 5 tips in one sitting, schedule across the week.
- The series prefix ("cursor tip 101:") creates brand recognition in the timeline.

## Topics

- Cursor workflows (plan mode, agent mode, context management, skill architecture)
- MCP server patterns (setup, debugging, configuration)
- Agent mode habits (when to use, when not to, context preservation)
- Slash command design (triggers, inputs, outputs)
- Content OS patterns (draft flows, voice loading, pillar selection)
- GTM tooling quick wins (Instantly, Clay, HubSpot one-liners)

## Voice Notes

- Same builder voice, maximum compression. every word earns its spot.
- One sentence per line. period. even more than usual on X.
- No sign-off on the main post. reply ends with ⚡ only.
- No storytelling. no narrative arc. just the pattern and the expand.
- Self-aware and opinionated. these are YOUR rules, stated as rules.

## Cadence

2-3x per week, interleaved with long-form threads and singles. these fill the gaps.

## Safety

Highest. sharing your own workflow patterns. no external critique.
