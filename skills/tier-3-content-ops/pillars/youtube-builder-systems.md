# Content Pillar: YouTube Builder & Systems

## Format

Long-form video content (12–25 min) that documents builds, workflows, and systems using tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and other AI-enhanced dev processes. Teaching through action — showing how you operate, build, and systematize ideas into code or frameworks.

## Content Types

### Build Walkthroughs

Screen-first, narrated builds from blank repo to working system.

- "How I built a repo in Cursor from scratch (with Claude)"
- "Building a content OS in real time — every skill, every workflow"
- Show the full process: the mess, the debugging, the working result

### System Explainers

Zoom out and explain the architecture. What connects to what and why.

- "My Content Operating System: Built in Cursor + AI"
- "The skill tree that runs my entire GTM workflow"
- Best when you can show the repo structure, the files, and how they interact

### GTM / Launch Systems

Show how the OS translates into actual go-to-market execution.

- "How I plan Go-To-Market using this OS"
- "From repo to revenue: the full pipeline"
- Connects technical builds to business outcomes

### Tool Tutorials / Comparisons

Real use-case comparisons. Not spec sheets — workflows.

- "Claude vs ChatGPT for dev workflows: Real use cases"
- "MCP servers I actually use and why"
- Side-by-side, in-context, with your actual projects

### Live Problem Solving

Unscripted debugging and building. The raw version.

- "Fixing my build with Cursor + Claude (in real time)"
- "Something broke — let's figure it out together"
- Highest authenticity, lowest polish. That's the point.

## Video Structure Framework

### Intro (0–90 seconds)

Set up what you're about to show, why it matters, and flash the end result. Hook viewers in the first 15 seconds — show the output or problem fast. Don't intro yourself for 45 seconds. Show the thing.

### Context (2–4 minutes)

Give background: why you're building this, what problem it solves, who it's for. This is where you earn the viewer's patience for the walkthrough.

### Walkthrough (10–15 minutes)

Show the tool + your thought process. Narrate as you go. Don't over-edit — the pauses, the cursor movements, the "let me think about this" moments are the content. Viewers learn from the process, not the result.

### Result / Reflection (3–5 minutes)

What worked, what didn't, next steps, how they can apply it. Be honest about rough edges. That's what makes it credible.

### Optional CTA (soft)

Invite to newsletter, GitHub, or more build content — value-led. Never "smash that subscribe button." More like: "if you want the full skill files I used in this build, they're on the newsletter."

## Duration Guidelines

| Video Type                 | Ideal Duration   |
|----------------------------|------------------|
| Cursor Build Walkthrough   | 12–18 minutes    |
| Content/GTM OS Explainers  | 15–25 minutes    |
| Tool Comparisons           | 10–15 minutes    |
| Live Sessions / Vlogs      | 20–30 minutes    |

## YouTube-Specific Best Practices

- **First 15 seconds**: Show the output or the problem. Not your face, not a logo, not "hey what's up."
- **Chapters**: Add timestamps for every section. Great for SEO, great for viewers who want to skip to the build.
- **Titles**: Always add value. "How to __" or "__ in real time" or "I built __ with __". Specific > clever.
- **Thumbnails**: Visual outcome + emotion or "dev face." Show the terminal, the result, the before/after.
- **Description**: First two lines matter most. Put the value prop and key links there.
- **Tags + metadata**: Include tool names (Cursor, Claude, MCP), workflow terms, and the problem being solved.

## Repurpose Paths

Every YouTube video should produce at least 2–3 derivative pieces:

| Source Section       | Repurpose Target           | Format                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Intro hook (15s)     | TikTok / Short             | Hook + flash result           |
| Single build step    | TikTok / Short             | Quick tutorial clip           |
| Full walkthrough     | LinkedIn post              | Compressed build story        |
| Result / Reflection  | X thread                   | Lessons + what shipped        |
| Entire script        | Newsletter deep dive       | Full written version          |
| Key insight          | LinkedIn carousel idea     | Step-by-step visual breakdown |

Use `/tiktokscript` to break YouTube sections into Shorts. Use `/substackpost repurpose` to convert the script into a newsletter issue.

## Collaborates With

- **Viral Hooks Skill** (`/viralhooks`): Shapes the title and opening 15 seconds.
- **Newsletter Repurpose Skill**: YouTube script becomes the newsletter base.
- **TikTok Script Skill** (`/tiktokscript`): Break down YouTube content into Shorts.
- **Play Draft Skill** (`/playdraft`): Build screenshots become LinkedIn/X posts alongside the video.
- **Skill Play Skill** (`/skillplay`): Skills demonstrated in the video become standalone social content.

## Output Format

When scripting or planning a YouTube video, produce:

1. **Title** — SEO-optimized, value-forward
2. **Description** — First 2 lines = hook + link. Rest = context + chapters
3. **Loose script or outline** — Section-by-section with talking points, not a teleprompter read
4. **Chapters** — Timestamped sections for the description
5. **Thumbnail concept** — What visual, what text overlay, what emotion
6. **Repurpose list** — Which sections become TikToks, posts, newsletter content

## What Makes This Pillar Work

- You're already building in Cursor every day — the video is the narration layer on top of what you're doing anyway
- Long-form lets you go deep where social forces compression — viewers who find you on YouTube get the full picture
- Build content ages well. A "how I built this" video is still useful a year later
- The repurpose path means one 15-minute video feeds a week of social content
- Teaching through doing is more credible than teaching through slides

## Voice Notes

- Narrate like you're pair-programming with a friend, not presenting to an audience
- "Let me show you" > "In this video I'm going to show you"
- Silence while you think is fine. Don't fill every second with narration.
- If something breaks, leave it in. The fix is the content.
- Speak to one person, not "you guys"
- Swearing is fine if it's natural. Don't sanitize the dev experience.

## Safety

High. You're showing your own builds, your own tools, your own process. No external critique. Only risk is accidentally showing sensitive partner data on screen — always check for that before recording or use dummy data.
