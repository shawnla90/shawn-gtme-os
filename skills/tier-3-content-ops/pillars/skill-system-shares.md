# Content Pillar: Skill/System Shares

## Format

Sharing your actual frameworks, skill files, validation systems, and methodologies.

## Structure

1. What you built and why
2. How it works (enough to be useful, not so much they don't need the file)
3. Where to get it (comments, link)
4. Comment thread with deeper insights and reasoning

## Real Examples

**29-pattern skill file:**
"built a skill .md file that catches AI writing patterns before you publish anything.
29 structural and formatting tells that trained readers spot immediately.
not a style guide. a pattern scanner that runs every time i generate content."

**Comment thread reasoning:**
"the 29 patterns in this file aren't random. they came from reading hundreds of posts and noticing what my brain flagged as AI before i could even explain why."

"you learn way more from reading the reasoning than from the rules themselves."

"if you grab this file and want to make it yours, start by adding patterns that bother YOU specifically."

## What Makes This Pillar Work

- You're sharing real operational tools, not theoretical frameworks
- The comment thread is where the deep value lives (reasoning, customization advice, meta-insights)
- "One skill file out of a full tree" signals there's more coming (follow incentive)
- Positions you as someone who builds systems for thinking, not just executing
- "Built this one for Claude but the logic works in any system prompt, custom GPT, or instruction doc" = platform agnostic

## Voice Notes

- More meta and reflective than plays posts
- The post sells the concept, the comments deliver the depth
- Invite people to make it theirs: "the structure matters more than my specific rules"
- This pillar is where the Lead Alchemy brand extends beyond just you doing GTM work

## Safety

High. You're sharing your own systems and thinking.
