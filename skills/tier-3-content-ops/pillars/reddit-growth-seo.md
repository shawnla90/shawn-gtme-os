# Content Pillar: Reddit Growth & SEO Layer

## Purpose

Turns Reddit into a strategic distribution and visibility layer by repurposing content into high-value posts that rank in search, earn engagement, and build long-term brand trust — without coming across as spammy or self-promotional.

## Format

Reddit-native posts adapted from existing social or newsletter content. Longer form than X, more conversational than LinkedIn. Written like you're explaining something to a smart friend in a niche community.

## Application

- Repurpose social or newsletter content into Reddit-native posts.
- Use Reddit threads to *test ideas*, get feedback, and spark discussion.
- Tap into niche subreddits for direct access to your target audience.
- Create value-first content that gets **upvoted, bookmarked, and indexed by Google**.

## Strategic Goals

- **Drive long-tail discovery via SEO**
  Reddit threads often rank top 5 for long-tail or question-based queries. A single well-written post can drive traffic for months.

- **Earn credibility in niche communities**
  Posting thoughtful, non-promotional insights builds brand equity in places where your exact audience already hangs out.

- **Reverse-funnel readers to newsletter or site**
  Use "soft" mentions or profile links to lead Reddit readers deeper. No hard CTAs — your profile and post history do the work.

- **Content validation & idea mining**
  Engage with threads to spot content gaps, trends, and real pain points. Reddit tells you what people actually want to know.

## Post Formats That Work

- **Personal Experience Posts**
  *"I used Claude Code to build 3 internal tools in 2 days. Here's how."*

- **Mini-Tutorials / Explainers**
  *"Here's a simple slash command trick that saves me 30 min daily in Cursor."*

- **AMA-Lite Threads**
  *"Been using AI tools daily in my workflow. Ask me anything (Claude, Cursor, GPT, etc.)"*

- **Redditified List Posts**
  *"5 Claude tips you won't find in the docs (but I use daily)"*

- **Case Study / Project Breakdowns**
  *"Built this internal automation stack using Claude + Zapier — results inside."*

## Rules of Reddit Posting (The Culture)

- Lead with **value, not links**.
- Write natively for Reddit — more like a blog post than a tweet.
- No hard CTAs. Use your profile or natural mentions if needed.
- Comment and engage — don't just post and ghost.
- If in doubt: Think "How would I say this to a smart friend?"
- Understand each sub's rules before posting. Mods are strict and bans are real.

## Collaborates With

- **Newsletter Repurpose Pillar**: Turn essays into Reddit-ready breakdowns.
- **Newsletter Growth Pillar**: Reddit as a top-of-funnel source for newsletter subscribers.
- **Voice Skill (Tier 1)**: Keep tone human, thoughtful, and honest — Reddit sniffs out corporate speak faster than any platform.
- **Editorial Pillar**: Include Reddit as a monthly touchpoint in the content calendar.
- **Substack Index**: Reddit posts can seed newsletter topics; newsletter content can compress into Reddit posts.

## Output Format

- Reddit-ready post (title + body)
- Target subreddit recommendations (1–3 subs per post)
- Soft CTA language (if any)
- Comment hooks to boost engagement

## Voice Notes

- Reddit rewards authenticity more than any other platform. Write like a real person.
- Self-deprecation and honesty outperform polish.
- Never reference follower counts, subscriber numbers, or "I'm an expert" framing.
- The best Reddit posts read like someone sharing something they learned — not someone marketing.
- Karma and post history matter. Consistent engagement > one viral post.

## Safety

Medium-high. Reddit communities are self-policing. Overtly promotional content gets downvoted or removed. Stay value-first and you're fine. Avoid naming clients or partners in Reddit posts — keep it about the system and the results.
