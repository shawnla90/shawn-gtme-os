# Content Pillar: Plays Series (Highest Performing)

## Format

"gtm plays i use every day, part [n] ⚡"

Screen recording or screenshot always attached. Full prompts/formulas delivered in comments.

## Structure

1. Pain point or contrarian hook (lowercase, 1-2 lines)
2. Series title + play number
3. Step-by-step workflow with emoji markers (✅ 🔧 🔗 🧠 ➡️)
4. "Why this matters" context
5. "No gatekeeping" + resource delivery to comments
6. Identity sign-off (shawn ⚡ / the gtme alchemist 🧙‍♂️)

## Real Examples of Openers

- "cold email is dead on arrival if you're only checking for google and microsoft."
- "most outbound still opens with 'hey saw you're growing'"
- "Your target account's competitors are a free strategy doc. almost no one reads it."
- "I almost nuked an entire enterprise list by accident."
- "alpha signals don't have to be expensive. some are just ignored."

## What Makes This Pillar Work

- Every post documents a real workflow running in production
- Technical specifics (column names, formulas, API setups, prompt structures)
- The screen recording proves it's real, not theoretical
- Comments section becomes a resource hub
- Each play is a standalone piece that also builds the series narrative
- The series numbering creates collectibility and follow incentive
