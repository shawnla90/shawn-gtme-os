# Content Pillar: Newsletter Repurpose

## Format

Bridge between short-form (LinkedIn, X) and long-form (Substack). Transforms existing social posts into newsletter-ready content. Sustainable content creation by expanding what you've already written.

## Format Templates

### Post to Essay

Expand a social post into a narrative-rich article or mini-essay.

- Source: High-performing LinkedIn post or X thread
- Output: 400–800 word Personal POV Essay or Tactical Breakdown
- The social post becomes the hook/intro; the essay goes deeper
- Add context, backstory, screenshots, and reasoning that didn't fit the social format

**Example**: A LinkedIn post about building two operating systems in a weekend → Substack essay with the full build log, skill tree screenshots, what broke, what worked, and what's next.

### Social Idea to Deep Dive

Take a one-liner insight or hook and build a full argument around it.

- Source: A single tweet, a LinkedIn opener that hit, or a comment thread insight
- Output: 300–600 word Contrarian Take or Tactical Breakdown
- The original line becomes the thesis; the article defends it
- Works best with contrarian takes or pattern observations

**Example**: "your outbound stack is a spreadsheet. mine is a git repo." → 500-word breakdown of why version-controlled GTM workflows outperform spreadsheets.

### Thread Recap to Newsletter Digest

Convert multiple threads or posts into a curated, themed newsletter issue.

- Source: 3–5 related social posts from the same week or theme
- Output: 300–500 word Curated Drop format
- Brief commentary on each, tied together by a theme
- Good for weeks with lots of social output but no single deep topic

**Example**: Three LinkedIn posts about Clay plays + two X threads about Cursor skills → "this week in the lab" curated issue.

### Story in Layers

Use a short-form story and break it into setup, moment, reflection for long-form.

- Source: A personal anecdote or build story from social
- Output: 400–700 word Personal POV Essay
- Social version was compressed; newsletter version breathes
- Setup → the moment → reflection → what it means

**Example**: "I almost nuked an entire enterprise list by accident" → full story of what happened, why the safety filter didn't catch it, what you built after.

### Newsletter to Reddit Adaptation

Compress a newsletter post into a Reddit-native breakdown for niche subreddit reach.

- Source: Published or draft Substack post
- Output: Reddit post (title + body) tailored to 1–3 target subreddits
- Strip newsletter formatting; write conversationally for Reddit culture
- No CTAs — let the profile and post quality do the work
- See `skills/tier-3-content-ops/pillars/reddit-growth-seo.md` for subreddit targeting and post formats

**Example**: Substack tactical breakdown on building a content OS → Reddit post in r/ClaudeAI or r/CursorAI: "Here's the system I use to go from idea to published post in 10 minutes with Cursor."

## Repurpose Decision Guide

| Social Signal | Newsletter Treatment |
|---|---|
| Post got high engagement + comments | Post to Essay (the audience wants more) |
| Post had a strong one-liner that resonated | Social Idea to Deep Dive |
| Multiple related posts in a week | Thread Recap to Digest |
| Post told a compressed story | Story in Layers |
| Post referenced a skill or play | Tactical Breakdown (newsletter version of /skillplay or /playdraft) |
| Newsletter post is tactical + niche | Reddit Adaptation (compress for subreddit reach + SEO) |

## What Makes This Pillar Work

- Eliminates "what do I write about" — the social feed is the topic queue
- Newsletter content is pre-validated by social performance
- Keeps creation sustainable — you're expanding, not starting from scratch
- Readers who follow on social AND subscribe get the deeper version, not a copy-paste
- The repurpose should feel like getting backstage access, not seeing a rerun

## Voice Notes

- Repurposed content must go deeper, not just longer. Adding filler to hit word count defeats the purpose.
- Reference the social post when it makes sense: "I posted about this on LinkedIn last week — here's the part I couldn't fit in 1000 characters."
- The newsletter version should stand alone. Someone who didn't see the social post should get full value.
- Use the `/substackpost repurpose <path>` command to start from an existing draft file.

## Safety

High. You're expanding your own content. No external critique.
