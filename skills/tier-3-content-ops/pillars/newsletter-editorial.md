# Content Pillar: Newsletter Editorial

## Format

Strategic consistency layer for Substack. Defines content rhythm, structures, and thematic sequencing so the newsletter feels intentional, not random.

## Content Structures

### The Personal POV Essay

Start with a story, zoom out to a lesson. The most narrative format.

- 400–800 words
- Personal opener: what you built, what broke, what shifted
- The process (messy, real, not polished)
- The insight or shift in thinking
- No hard CTA — the insight IS the value

**When to use**: After a significant build, a mindset shift, or a pivot moment. The Cursor origin story energy.

### The Tactical Breakdown

Step-by-step or "how I did it." The newsletter version of a GTM Play or Skill Play.

- 500–800 words
- Screenshots and code inline
- Numbered steps or clear section headers
- Enough detail to be useful, not so much they don't need to try it themselves

**When to use**: When you ship a new skill, workflow, or play. The "here's exactly how" format.

### The Contrarian Take

Opinion-based issue with a strong stance.

- 300–600 words
- Lead with the take, defend with specifics
- Conviction-driven, not clickbait
- Best when reacting to something real — a trend, a tool release, a pattern

**When to use**: When you have a strong opinion on something the audience is talking about. Release reactions, industry patterns, tool critiques.

### The Curated Drop

Links + commentary on what you're watching, reading, building.

- 300–500 words
- 3–5 items with your take on each
- Lowest lift format
- Good for weeks when you're building more than writing

**When to use**: When the week was more building than content. Ship a curated drop and get back to work.

## Editorial Rhythm

**Target cadence**: Weekly or biweekly. Consistency > frequency.

**Suggested rotation** (once rhythm is established):
- Week 1: Tactical Breakdown (skill or play deep dive)
- Week 2: Personal POV Essay or Contrarian Take
- Week 3: Tactical Breakdown
- Week 4: Curated Drop or POV Essay

This is a guide, not a calendar. Follow what you're building. If you shipped 3 skills in a week, write the tactical breakdown. If you're reflecting on the journey, write the POV essay.

## Topic Selection

Topics come from what you're already doing:

- **New skill built** → Tactical Breakdown
- **LinkedIn post that performed** → Expand into any structure (Repurpose pillar)
- **Strong reaction to a tool or trend** → Contrarian Take
- **Busy build week, not much writing energy** → Curated Drop
- **Milestone or pivot** → Personal POV Essay

The editorial skill doesn't generate topics from scratch — it maps your existing output to the right structure.

## Headline + Subject Line Guide

Subject line is the hook. Preview text is the context.

- **Subject line**: 5–10 words, lowercase, scroll-stop energy
- **Preview text**: 1 sentence, what this issue covers

**Tactical Breakdown**: "how I built [thing] inside [tool]" / "[thing] skill, from file to workflow"
**POV Essay**: "the week I [pivoted/broke/rebuilt something]" / "[insight] changed how I build"
**Contrarian Take**: "why [common belief] is wrong" / "[strong stance] and here's why"
**Curated Drop**: "5 things I used this week" / "what I'm building, reading, watching"

## What Makes This Pillar Work

- The newsletter has a personality, not just a schedule
- Content structures give each issue a clear shape without being formulaic
- Topics come from the daily workflow, so there's always something to write about
- The 50 early subs get a consistent, recognizable format — they know what to expect but not what's coming

## Voice Notes

- Long-form doesn't mean formal. Same casual builder voice, just more room to breathe.
- Substack readers chose to open your email. Respect that by delivering more depth than social.
- Each issue should have one clear takeaway. If someone reads it and can't summarize it in a sentence, it's too scattered.
- The editorial rhythm serves you, not the other way around. Skip a week if there's nothing worth saying.

## Safety

High. You're planning your own content calendar and structures. No external targets.
