# Content Pillar: GTM Memes

## Format

Short text + meme/gif/video. Funny but always a real lesson underneath.

## Structure

1. Setup line (the relatable GTM pain)
2. Punchline or meme context
3. Optional engagement ask ("what's your version?")
4. Brief sign-off or p.s.

## Real Examples

**Yamcha/RAM:**
"my CPU after I run Clay + HubSpot + 6 Loom tabs + clickup + VEED + claude code 🧱
the Yamcha effect is real. one 50k Clay table and it's game over.
is 32GB the new minimum or does gtm engineering just eat RAM for fun?"

**John Cena deliverability:**
"when the client says... why can't we just send 200 emails a day per inbox
true story. 😅
ps: john cena tapping out might still be less painful than watching someone ignore deliverability rules"

**"I was that SDR":**
"What I'm thinking when someone says... we send 200+ cold emails a day per SDR. no big deal.
true story. 😅
P.S. I was that SDR."

## Pop Culture Reference Library

- **Anime**: Dragon Ball Z (Yamcha crater)
- **Wrestling**: WWE (John Cena tap-out)
- **Music**: Avicii, SoundCloud-era references
- **General**: Leonardo DiCaprio meme formats

## What Makes This Pillar Work

- Short and punchy. No long workflow breakdown.
- The meme does the heavy lifting visually
- Always a real GTM lesson underneath the joke (deliverability, RAM constraints, outdated practices)
- Engagement asks are natural here ("what's your version? drop it")
- Self-deprecating: the joke is often on you or your past self
- The p.s. line is a second punchline or insight

## Voice Notes

- Most casual of all pillars
- Engagement bait endings are acceptable here (and only here)
- Can break anti-slop rules slightly because the tone is lighter
- Keep the lesson subtle. Don't explain the joke.

## Safety

High. Target is relatable pain, not specific people or companies.
