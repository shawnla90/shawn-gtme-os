# Content Pillar: Building & Sharing

## Format

Narrative, reflective, personal journey. More storytelling than structure.

## Structure

1. Personal opener (what you built, what broke, what you learned)
2. The process (messy, real, not polished)
3. The insight or shift in thinking
4. Invitation to connect or follow along

## Real Examples

**Cursor origin story:**
"the cursor era has begun. at least for me. built a meme generator app today. not because I needed one but because I needed something I could break."

**Content creation meta:**
"This key combo turns your day job into content. Command + Shift + 5. That's it. That's the cheat code."

## What Makes This Pillar Work

- Longer sentences allowed. More breathing room.
- The messy reality is the content (6 hours debugging a 90-minute table, macOS invisible characters)
- Shows the tool journey: "14 months ago I didn't think I'd be the clay guy. now I'm starting that same climb with cursor."
- Meta-content about how you create content (screen recording workflow) resonates because it's teachable
- Avicii tribute, personal references, the human behind the builder

## Voice Notes

- More reflective than plays posts
- Sentences can be longer, paragraphs can breathe more
- Self-deprecating humor lands here ("I'm not too proud to admit it")
- Forward-looking invitations: "follow along if you want to see how it plays out"

## Safety

Highest. You're the subject. No external critique.
