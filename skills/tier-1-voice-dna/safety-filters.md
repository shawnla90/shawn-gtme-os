# Safety Filters

## Pattern vs. Person Test

**Safe to critique**:
- CRM architectures (generic)
- GTM approaches (methodologies)
- Common mistakes (patterns)
- Tools/platforms (in general terms)

**Not safe to critique**:
- Specific clients (even anonymized if recognizable)
- Named competitors
- Individual practitioners
- Companies in your ecosystem
