# Viral Hooks for Copy Content

> **Layer type**: Creative benchmark. Complements voice and brand — does not override.
> **Inherits from**: `core-voice.md`
> **Activates at**: Hook level only (first 1–3 lines)

## Purpose

This layer sharpens the attention-grabbing power of copy across LinkedIn and X without altering brand voice or tone. It is **not hierarchical** to Voice or Brand Core — it functions as a creative benchmark layer, guiding compelling hooks designed to stop the scroll and earn engagement within the first 1–3 seconds of reading.

## Application

- Enhances opening lines (hooks) of social content
- Prioritizes **clarity**, **curiosity**, **disruption**, or **emotional resonance**
- Complements existing voice and brand strategy
- Platform-aware (snappy for X, more thought-provoking for LinkedIn) while staying true to core identity

## Hook Styles (Examples)

- **Curiosity Pings**  
  you're not supposed to know this — but here's the trick top founders use…

- **Contrarian POVs**  
  I ignored everyone's advice — and that's why it worked.

- **Data Bombs**  
  91% of posts fail. here's what the top 9% are doing differently.

- **Story Openers**  
  three years ago I almost quit. then something unexpected happened…

- **Problem-First**  
  your content isn't boring — it's just missing this one thing.

- **Direct Challenge**  
  if you can't explain your product in 10 words, you don't understand it.

## Platform Considerations

**LinkedIn**
- Lean into professional stakes, career journeys, insights with emotional or intellectual weight
- Example: the first time I fired someone, I cried in the bathroom.

**X (Twitter)**
- Fast hooks, punchy facts, meme-ability, concise threads
- Example: this founder built 3 products before he ever launched one.

**TikTok / Reels / Shorts**
- On-screen text IS the hook. 8 words or fewer. Must work without sound.
- Curiosity or pain point in the first 1 second of video.
- Result-first hooks drive replay value (show the outcome, then how).
- Example (on-screen text): you're using Claude wrong. here's why.
- Example (result-first): 30 minutes of work. 3 seconds.
- Example (challenge): I bet you've never tried this in Cursor.

## Benchmarks for Success

- Scroll-stopping in 1–3 seconds
- Opens curiosity loops or sets a bold tone
- Harmonizes with voice skill: same tone, amplified impact
- Sets up strong narrative or insight that supports the rest of the post

## Collaborates With

- **Voice Skill** (`core-voice.md`): Ensures hook matches tone, persona, and style
- **Brand Core**: Ensures alignment with positioning, values, and POV
- **Platform Playbooks** (`linkedin.md`, `x-twitter.md`, `tiktok.md`): Platform-specific opener guidance

## Output Format

When creating new post content, activate at the **hook level** only — provide **2–5 options** per piece to test or inspire the first line. Hooks can be standalone or part of a broader thread/post outline.

## Formatting Rules (Must Match Voice)

- Lowercase first word (unless proper noun or first-person I)
- Always capitalize I, I'm, I'll
- No quotation marks — write phrases directly
- Builder-first, casual competence, pattern articulation
