# YouTube Playbook

> Inherits from: `tier-1-voice-dna/core-voice.md`
> Status: Stub. To be built out as channel launches.

## Planned Approach

Expand LinkedIn workflow plays into full video walkthroughs. The screen recordings already exist as content source material. YouTube = longer format, deeper explanation, same builder voice.

## Content Types (Planned)

- Full workflow walkthroughs (plays series expanded to 5-15 min)
- Tool deep dives (Clay, Cursor, Claude Code in action)
- Build-in-public series (live builds with mistakes included)
- GTM system architecture breakdowns

## Migration Strategy

- LinkedIn screen recordings --> expanded with voiceover and context
- Plays series --> episode format with consistent intro/outro
- Comments resources --> video description links

## Open Questions

- Channel naming (Lead Alchemy? Shawn Tenam? GTME Alchemist?)
- Intro/outro format
- Thumbnail style
- Upload cadence
