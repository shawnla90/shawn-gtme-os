# Substack Playbook

## Platform DNA

Substack is the deep-dive layer. LinkedIn and X hook, compress, and spark. Substack expands, deepens, and builds the longer relationship. This is where a 3-line hook becomes a 600-word breakdown. Where a screenshot becomes a full build log. Where the 50 early subs become the core audience that follows the whole arc.

## Brand Evolution

**Legacy**: "Inside the Lab" volumes (Vol. 0–3 + Backstory Build) on Beehiiv. Custom anime artwork per issue. High production overhead.

**New era**: "AI Alchemy" (working name). Same Alchemist/Lab DNA, new format. Visuals come from actual builds — Cursor screenshots, repo tree views, Claude chat outputs, screen recordings. The content IS the visual. No separate art production step.

**What carries forward**: The Alchemist identity, the builder-first energy, the no-gatekeeping principle, the Lead Alchemy brand.

**What changes**: Volume numbering → post numbering (tracked in `workflows/substack-index.md`). Anime art → build artifacts. Signal-chaining deep dives → Content OS and Cursor skill deep dives (plus GTM when it fits).

## Tone

Long-form extension of builder voice. More reflective, more room to breathe. Sentences can run longer than LinkedIn. Paragraphs can have 2–3 sentences. But the same casual competence — never academic, never corporate.

Think: the version of you that sits down after shipping something and explains how the whole thing works to someone who's about to build their own.

## Content Structures

### The Personal POV Essay

Start with a story, zoom out to a lesson. Most narrative of the four.

- 400–800 words
- First-person, reflective
- The messy reality is the content
- Ends with an insight or shift in thinking, not a CTA

### The Tactical Breakdown

Step-by-step or "how I did it." The Substack version of a GTM Play or Skill Play.

- 500–800 words
- Screenshots and code snippets inline (not just in comments)
- Numbered steps or clear sections
- Enough to be useful, not so much they don't need to build it themselves

### The Contrarian Take

Opinion-based issue that takes a strong stance.

- 300–600 words
- Lead with the take, defend it with specifics
- Conviction-driven, not clickbait
- Works best when you're reacting to something real (a trend, a tool release, a pattern you keep seeing)

### The Curated Drop

Links + commentary on things you're watching, reading, building.

- 300–500 words
- 3–5 items with your take on each
- Good for weeks when you're building more than writing
- Lowest lift, still delivers value

## Word Count Range

300–800 words per post. Can go longer for essays if the content earns it. Shorter is fine for curated drops. The constraint is substance, not length.

## Opening Line Style

Same rules as LinkedIn — lowercase first word, capitalize I, strong hook in first 1–2 lines. But Substack gives you a subject line AND a preview text, so the hook gets split:

- **Subject line**: The scroll-stop. Short, punchy, curiosity or contrarian.
- **Preview text**: The context line. What this issue covers. 1 sentence.
- **First line of body**: Can be softer than LinkedIn because the subject line already hooked them. Start with story, context, or the setup.

## Subject Line Style

- Lowercase unless proper noun or I
- No clickbait, no question marks for engagement
- Should work as a standalone statement
- 5–10 words ideal

**Good**: "I built a content operating system inside a code editor"
**Good**: "the skill tree that runs my entire workflow"
**Good**: "why I stopped making AI art for my newsletter"
**Bad**: "You Won't Believe What I Built This Weekend!"
**Bad**: "Newsletter Update #6"

## Sign-Off Style

Same identity anchors as LinkedIn/X:

- "shawn ⚡ the gtme alchemist 🧙‍♂️"
- "- shawn ⚡"

Substack feels more personal, so the sign-off can be warmer. Optional: add a 1-line "what's next" or "what I'm building" teaser before the sign-off.

## CTA Style

Substack CTAs serve a different purpose than LinkedIn. You're not driving to comments — you're building the subscriber relationship and cross-pollinating.

**Growth CTAs** (from newsletter-growth pillar):
- "if this hit, share it with someone building their own system"
- "the full skill file is on GitHub — link below"
- "reply to this email and tell me what you'd build first"

**Cross-platform CTAs**:
- "I broke this down in a LinkedIn post last week — deeper version here"
- "the condensed thread version of this is on X"

**Never**:
- "subscribe for more"
- "like and share"
- Generic engagement bait

## Visual Strategy

No more custom artwork. Visuals come from the build:

- **Cursor screenshots**: Skill files open, chat with slash commands, tree view
- **Repo tree views**: The generated tree visualization
- **Claude/AI chat outputs**: The actual conversation that produced something
- **Screen recordings**: Short clips of workflows running (embedded or linked)
- **Code snippets**: Inline, not as images

One visual per post minimum. It should be something you already have from building — zero extra production time.

## Cross-Posting Rules

| Content Type | Origin | Substack Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| GTM Plays | LinkedIn first | Expand into Tactical Breakdown 3–5 days later |
| Skill Plays | LinkedIn first | Expand into Tactical Breakdown or POV Essay |
| Build logs | X or LinkedIn first | Expand into full story (Personal POV Essay) |
| Hot takes | X native | Expand into Contrarian Take if it has legs |
| Original deep dives | Substack first | Condense for LinkedIn/X after publish |
| Curated drops | Substack native | Tease on X/LinkedIn with 1 highlight |

## Frequency

Start with 1x per week or biweekly. Consistency matters more than frequency, especially with 50 subs who haven't heard from you in 9 months. Build the rhythm, then increase.

## Formatting Rules

- **Capital I**: Always. Same as every platform.
- **No quotation marks**: Same rule. Write phrases directly.
- **No em-dashes**: Period + space for breaks. Same as LinkedIn/X.
- **Markdown native**: Substack supports markdown. Use headers, bold, code blocks, bullet lists natively. No need to strip like LinkedIn.
- **Headers for sections**: Use `##` for major sections in longer posts. Helps scanability.

## Avoid

- Volume numbering (that era is done)
- Custom artwork production (the build is the visual)
- Generic newsletter language ("in this issue", "happy Tuesday")
- Over-polished tone (Substack readers want the real version)
- Gatekeeping (same rule everywhere — resources in the post, not behind a paywall)
- Posting without a visual (every post gets at least one screenshot or artifact)
