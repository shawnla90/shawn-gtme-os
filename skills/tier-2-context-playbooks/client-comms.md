## Context

Emails, decks, recaps, status updates.

## Tone

Clear, confident, collaborative.

## Structure

- Diagnosis (what we observed)
- Impact (what it's costing/limiting)
- Next step (specific, actionable)

## Avoid

- Sounding frantic or uncertain
- Over-selling results
- Shifting blame
- Generic recommendations

## Example

```
Quick status update on the Alumni Champion build:

What's done:
- Clay table pulling 150 closed-won contacts with champion tags
- Enrichment running weekly to detect job changes
- HubSpot properties created for champion tracking

What's live:
- 12 champions identified at new companies this week
- Companies flagged with has_alumni_champion property
- View created for sales to filter by champion accounts

What's next:
- Setting up automated Slack alerts for high-value changes
- Building lookalike scoring for champion's new buying committees

Blocker:
- Need confirmation on whether to auto-create deals or keep manual for now

Let me know which direction you prefer.
