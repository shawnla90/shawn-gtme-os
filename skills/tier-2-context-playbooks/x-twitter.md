# X (Twitter) Playbook

> Inherits from: `tier-1-voice-dna/core-voice.md`

## Platform DNA

X is the compressed version of LinkedIn. Same builder voice, faster pace, tighter constraints. LinkedIn is the long-form stage. X is the live feed from the workshop.

## Tone

Casual, builder, punchy. Everything that works on LinkedIn but stripped to the bone. No filler sentences. Every line earns its spot.

## Format Strategy

**Single posts**: Memes, reactions, one-liners, hot takes. Under 280 chars when possible. Screenshot or GIF attached.

**Threads**: Plays series (condensed), system shares, build logs. Each tweet in the thread should stand alone -- someone scrolling should get value from any single tweet even without the rest.

**Quote tweets / replies**: Engage the GTM builder community. Add a real take, not "great post."

## Opening Line Style

- **Always lowercase first word** (same as LinkedIn), except first-person **I** — always capitalize I, I'm, I'll, I built, etc.
- Hooks even harder than LinkedIn -- you're competing with the entire timeline, not just a feed
- First tweet of a thread must be self-contained and compelling on its own
- **Hook inspiration**: For fast hooks, punchy facts, meme-ability, see `tier-1-voice-dna/viral-hooks.md`. Same voice, amplified impact.

**Good X openers**:
- "built two operating systems this weekend. inside a code editor."
- "your outbound stack is a spreadsheet. mine is a git repo."
- "cold email is dead on arrival if you're only checking google and microsoft."
- "cursor + claude code + mcp servers = GTM infrastructure that versions itself."

**Bad**: Anything that needs "read more" to deliver value. The first tweet IS the hook.

## Character Awareness

- Single tweet: 280 chars. Write tight.
- Thread tweets: still 280 each, but you have room to breathe across multiple
- Don't pad to fill 280. A 140-char banger beats a 280-char nothing.
- Line breaks count as characters. Use them intentionally.

## Paragraph Structure

- One sentence per line. Period.
- Single-line statements hit hardest on X
- No multi-sentence paragraphs -- that's LinkedIn energy
- Whitespace between thoughts (blank lines)

## Emoji Usage

Same structural approach as LinkedIn, but even more restrained:

**Identity markers**: ⚡ 🧙‍♂️ (keep these consistent across platforms)
**Step markers in threads**: ⚡ → 🔧 → ✅ (simplified from LinkedIn's full set)
**Tone signaling**: 😅 😏 (sparingly -- one per post max)

Don't emoji-load on X. The timeline is noisy enough.

## Content Pillars on X

### Plays Series (Condensed Threads)

LinkedIn plays get condensed into 4-6 tweet threads. Format:

1. **Hook tweet**: Pain point + "here's the play ⚡" (stands alone)
2. **Setup tweet**: What tool + what signal
3. **Steps tweets**: 1-2 steps per tweet, emoji-marked
4. **Result tweet**: What this actually does for pipeline
5. **Resource tweet**: "full prompt in the reply" or link back to LinkedIn post

Schedule: 1-2 days after the LinkedIn version drops. X gets the cliff notes, LinkedIn has the full breakdown.

### Building & Sharing (Build Logs)

Shorter, punchier than LinkedIn's narrative style:
- What you built
- One key insight
- Screenshot or tree view attached
- "more on this soon" energy

### Memes / Hot Takes (Native X Content)

This is where X-native content lives. Not repurposed from LinkedIn:
- GTM hot takes (one tweet, no thread)
- Tool reactions (screenshot + one-liner)
- Pop culture GTM parallels (same anime/wrestling/music references)

### System Shares (Thread Format)

When sharing frameworks or skill files:
1. What it is + why you built it
2. How it works (2-3 tweets of specifics)
3. Where to get it (link or "reply for the file")

## Sign-Off Style

Adapted for X's tighter format:

**End of threads**: "- shawn ⚡" or "shawn 🧙‍♂️"
**Single tweets**: No sign-off needed if profile does the work. Optional "⚡" at the end.
**Bio does the heavy lifting**: Profile should say "the gtme alchemist" so every tweet carries the brand without explicit sign-off.

## CTA Style

**Resource delivery**:
- "full prompt in the reply ⚡"
- "linked the breakdown in the reply"
- "no gatekeeping. file's in the thread."

**Follow / engage**:
- "building this in public. follow along if you want the mess and the wins."
- "more plays coming. follow if you're building GTM systems too."

**Never**:
- "like and RT if you agree"
- "follow for more tips"
- "thoughts?"

## Cross-Posting Rules

| Content Type | Origin Platform | X Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Plays series | LinkedIn first | Condensed thread 1-2 days later |
| Build logs | X first or same day | X gets the raw take, LinkedIn gets the expanded narrative |
| Memes | X native | Only cross-post to LinkedIn if it performs |
| System shares | LinkedIn first | Thread summary on X with link back |
| YouTube drops | Both same day | X gets the teaser clip + link |

## Thread Formatting

```
tweet 1: hook (standalone value)

tweet 2: context / setup

tweet 3-5: the substance (steps, insights, specifics)

tweet 6: resource delivery or CTA

tweet 7 (optional): sign-off or "follow for more of this"
```

Separate each tweet in drafts with `---` for easy copy-paste.

## Avoid

- **Quotation marks** — no quoted phrases. Write directly: I'll write about it later, not "I'll write about it later"
- Long paragraphs (this isn't LinkedIn)
- Threads longer than 8 tweets (diminishing returns)
- Generic motivational content
- Engagement bait without substance
- Gatekeeping (same rule everywhere)
- Over-hashtagging (one relevant hashtag max, zero is fine)
