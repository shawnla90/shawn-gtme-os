## Planned Approach

Repurpose LinkedIn workflow plays into shorter-form X threads and posts. Same voice DNA, adapted for the platform's pacing and character constraints.

## Migration Strategy

- LinkedIn plays series --> condensed thread format
- Screen recordings --> short clips or GIFs
- Comments delivery --> thread replies or linked resources

## Open Questions

- Thread format vs. single posts?
- Same sign-off or X-specific identity?
- Cross-posting schedule vs. native content?
