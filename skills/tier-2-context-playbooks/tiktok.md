# TikTok Playbook

## Platform DNA

TikTok is the compression layer underneath X. LinkedIn tells the story. X gives you the cliff notes. TikTok gives you the moment. One win, one demo, one scroll-stop. 16 seconds or less. The entire platform runs on "fast, useful, loopable" — and that's exactly how builder content should work here.

This isn't a dance platform anymore. It's where people learn things in 15 seconds that would take a blog post 10 minutes to explain. That's the lane.

## Tone

Same builder voice, maximum visual compression. Educational but never lecture-y. Casual, clever, "here's how to do this thing you didn't know you could do" energy. Think: the version of you that shows someone a shortcut over their shoulder in 12 seconds and walks away.

No corporate. No tutorial channel energy. No "hey guys, today we're going to..." — the demo IS the content.

## Core Video Structure (16 Seconds or Less)

### 1. Hook (0-2 seconds)

Hit curiosity or pain point immediately. On-screen text carries 90% of the stop. Voice optional but powerful when paired.

**Rules**:
- On-screen text first. Always.
- One sentence. Bold. Clear.
- Lowercase first word (same voice rules apply). Always capitalize I.
- Match the same hook energy from `tier-1-voice-dna/viral-hooks.md` — compressed for video.

**Hook examples**:
- "you're using Claude wrong. here's why."
- "this Cursor trick saved me hours."
- "3-second way to auto-generate docs using slash commands."
- "stop using Claude like ChatGPT. do this instead."
- "Cursor's best feature is hidden."
- "one slash command = hours saved."
- "if you write code, you need this."
- "everyone's missing this ChatGPT upgrade in Claude."

### 2. Demo (3-10 seconds)

Show the thing happening. No long explanation. Screen recording or over-the-shoulder style.

**Rules**:
- Screen capture is king. Show the tool doing the work.
- Zoom into the action. Crop tight on what matters.
- Split-screen or green screen overlay when you need face + screen.
- Fast cuts. No dead time. Every frame earns its spot.
- Avoid slow talking — the visual IS the explanation.

### 3. Result (10-14 seconds)

Show what happened. The output. The saved time. The working thing.

**What to show**:
- Time saved (before/after)
- Visual result or output
- Code working / running
- Problem solved / pain removed
- The "holy shit" moment

### 4. Loop Closer (14-16 seconds)

Soft CTA or visual loop back to the hook. Drives replay value.

**Options**:
- "save this" / "try it in Claude" / "part 2?"
- Visual loop — end frame matches start frame (great for auto-replays)
- Comment prompt: "which one should I show next?"
- Series tease: "follow for more of these"

## Content Pillars on TikTok

### Easy Wins with Claude Code

Single-use-case demos. One slash command or Claude Code feature per video.

- "here's how to [do X] in Claude Code"
- Screen recording of the command running
- Show the output / time saved
- Lowest lift, highest volume potential

### Cursor in 15 Seconds

Cursor-specific shortcuts, features, and tricks most people miss.

- Hidden features, keyboard shortcuts, MCP integrations
- Always screen-captured, zoomed, annotated
- "you didn't know Cursor could do this" energy

### Slash Commands You Didn't Know You Needed

Showcase the skills and slash commands from the content OS.

- Bridge between the "skill tree" repo and TikTok audience
- Each video = one command, one result
- Natural funnel to GitHub / LinkedIn / Substack for depth

### One Shortcut a Day

Daily cadence series. Low-lift, high-consistency.

- Any tool: Claude, Cursor, Clay, HeyReach, n8n
- Formula: problem (2s) + shortcut (8s) + result (4s) + save CTA (2s)
- Works as a recurring series hook

### Do This, Not That (AI Tool Edition)

Comparison format. Side-by-side or sequential.

- "don't do [common approach]. do [better approach] instead."
- Split screen works well here
- Built-in hook: the "wrong way" creates tension

### GTM Plays (The 30-Second Version)

Repurposed from the LinkedIn Plays series. The key moment from each play, compressed to TikTok length.

- Extracts the "aha moment" from the full play
- Screen recording of the critical step
- "full breakdown on LinkedIn" as CTA (cross-platform funnel)
- Reference: `workflows/plays-index.md` for source material

## Visual + Audio Strategy

### Visual Rules

- **Bold text overlays**: Large, readable on mobile. 2-3 words max per text block.
- **Captions always on**: Most people watch without sound. On-screen text is the content.
- **Screen recordings**: Crop tight. Zoom on the action. No full-screen IDE shots — too much noise.
- **Split-screen / green screen**: Face + screen when personality matters. Screen-only when the demo speaks for itself.
- **Fast cuts and zooms**: Use CapCut, TikTok editor, or Descript. No static shots longer than 3 seconds.

### Audio Rules

- **Trending sounds** (muted or low) + text overlay = safe default
- **Direct-to-cam voiceover** when the personality adds value
- **Screen recording with narration** for complex demos
- **No background music that competes with speech**
- **Green screen mode** to comment over your own tool usage

### Branding

- Same identity markers: ⚡ 🧙‍♂️ when they fit naturally (profile, bio, occasional overlay)
- Username / handle visible in profile, not watermarked on every video
- Builder energy comes through the content, not the branding
- TikTok-native feel first, brand consistency second

## Caption + Tags Strategy

### Caption Style

- Lowercase first word. Capitalize I. Same rules as everywhere.
- Short and punchy. 1-2 lines max.
- The caption supports the video — it doesn't replace it.
- End with a soft CTA or series identifier.

**Good captions**:
- "Claude Code trick that saves me 30 minutes every morning ⚡"
- "Cursor shortcut no one talks about. save this."
- "stop manually writing docs. let Claude do it."

**Bad captions**:
- Long paragraphs nobody reads
- "Hey guys! In today's video..."
- Engagement bait without substance

### Tags

- 3-5 relevant tags per video
- Mix niche and broad: `#claudeai` `#cursoride` `#codingshortcuts` `#devtips` `#aitools`
- Don't over-tag. 5 is the max.
- Series-specific tag when running a series (e.g., `#easywinswithclaude`)

## Series Format

Series are the growth engine on TikTok. Each series should:

- Have a clear naming pattern viewers recognize
- Use consistent visual formatting (same text style, same hook pattern)
- Number or title each episode
- Build a playlist viewers can binge

**Active series** (tracked in `workflows/tiktok-index.md`):
- Easy Wins with Claude Code
- Cursor in 15 Seconds
- Slash Commands You Didn't Know You Needed
- One Shortcut a Day
- Do This, Not That (AI Tool Edition)

## Cross-Posting Rules

| Content Type | Origin | TikTok Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| GTM Plays | LinkedIn first | Extract 30-sec key moment 1-3 days later |
| Skill Plays | LinkedIn first | Demo the slash command in action |
| Build logs | X or LinkedIn first | Screen recording of the build moment |
| Memes | X native | Adapt to video meme format (green screen, trending sound) |
| Tutorials | TikTok native | Keep here first. Cross-post to Reels/Shorts same day. |
| Claude/Cursor tips | TikTok native | These live here first. Expand to LinkedIn/X if they perform. |

## Cross-Platform Distribution

Every TikTok should also go to:
- **Instagram Reels**: Same video, same caption. Post simultaneously or within 24 hours.
- **YouTube Shorts**: Same video. Caption may need slight adjustment for YouTube audience.
- **LinkedIn video** (optional): Only if the tip is business/GTM relevant. Not every Cursor trick needs a LinkedIn post.

## Workflow

1. Identify the win / tip / moment (from a play, a build, a skill, or a random discovery)
2. Script using `/tiktokscript` or outline manually (hook + demo + result + closer)
3. Record screen capture (QuickTime, OBS, or built-in recorder)
4. Edit in CapCut or Descript (text overlays, zoom, cuts, sound)
5. Draft goes in `content/tiktok/drafts/` as markdown script
6. Post to TikTok. Cross-post to Reels + Shorts.
7. Move to `content/tiktok/final/` after posting.

## Formatting Rules (Same Voice, Video Medium)

- **Lowercase first word** in all text overlays and captions (unless proper noun or I)
- **Always capitalize I**, I'm, I'll
- **No quotation marks** — write phrases directly
- **No em-dashes** — period + space for breaks
- **Builder-first, casual competence** — same energy, different medium
- **No "hey guys"** — just start with the hook. Always.

## Frequency

Start with 3x per week. TikTok rewards consistency over quality-per-post. One "banger" per week, two solid tips. Ramp to daily when the workflow is dialed in.

## Avoid

- Tutorial channel energy ("today we're going to learn...")
- Videos longer than 60 seconds (aim for 16, cap at 30 for complex demos)
- Static screen recordings with no text overlays
- Gatekeeping (same rule everywhere — share the resource, share the command)
- Over-produced content (raw screen recordings with text > polished motion graphics)
- Generic AI content that could be about any tool
- Posting without captions/text (most viewers have sound off)
