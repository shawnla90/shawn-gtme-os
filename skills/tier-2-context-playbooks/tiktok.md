# TikTok Playbook

> Inherits from: `tier-1-voice-dna/core-voice.md`
> Status: Stub. To be built out as content expands.

## Planned Approach

Short-form clips from workflow screen recordings and GTM memes. Same builder voice, maximum compression.

## Content Types (Planned)

- 30-60 second workflow clips (the "aha moment" from each play)
- GTM memes with video format
- Quick tips and gotchas from builds

## Migration Strategy

- LinkedIn screen recordings --> trimmed to key moment
- Meme posts --> video meme format
- Plays series --> "the 30 second version"

## Open Questions

- Same identity branding or TikTok-native style?
- Music/audio strategy
- Cross-posting vs. native content
