# Morning Briefing — Wednesday, February 18, 2026

**Generated:** 11:07 AM EST
**Coverage:** Slack (Lead Alchemy, RevPartners) + ClickUp

---

## ⚠️ Access Limitations

**Bot Membership Issue:** The Slack bot is not a member of most channels in either workspace. Only accessible channels were scanned:
- slack-lead-alchemy: `reminder-channel`, `ideas` (2/5 channels)
- slack-revpartners: 0/20+ channels accessible

**ClickUp Status:** Not authenticated (401 error). Run `mcporter auth clickup` to enable task scanning.

**Recommendation:** Add the Slack bot to key channels for comprehensive briefings:
- Lead Alchemy: `all-lead-alchemy`, `new-channel`, `social`
- RevPartners: `doer-of-big-things`, `business-ops-bulletin`, `growth-marketing-team-bulletin`, `demand-gen-team`, `sales-team`, `hubspot-questions`
