**Steve's ask:**  
> "I have 312 matching jobs... I want to market my candidate... How do I find the hiring managers within these companies? ... How do I get them into Instantly so I don't have to depend on you?"

**Shawn's scope:**  
- Find 2–3 hiring managers per company (~900 leads)  
- Enrich via Prospio API in Clay (no Clay credits)  
- MX routing: Google → Instantly, Microsoft → Instantly, Proofpoint → HeyReach (email won't get through)  
- 5 steps: find contacts → enrich → route → push to Instantly/HeyReach  

**Turnaround estimate (Shawn):** "Three to four hours with the formula" for one workflow + get into Instantly + reusable table.

**Steve's urgency:** "Can we get in there by tomorrow so I can start sending?"

**Agreed timeline:** Steve sends tonight → Shawn delivers plan EOD tomorrow → Approve → Build block → Thursday campaign live.
