## Key Exchanges

### Steve's Goals (from initial notes, Jan 22)

Steve's stated goals for the engagement:

1. Plan completed every night with names, phone numbers, emails
2. Make AT LEAST 20 BD calls EVERY DAY
3. Calls based on similar searches (geography or company type), MPCs, signals
4. Easy tracking of calls, emails, texts, LinkedIn messages
5. Automated note-taking for candidate data entry
6. Summarize call notes for easier presentations
7. Summarize all calls into one master document for LinkedIn posts
8. Job posting signals → score jobs → find hiring manager + contact info → create daily call list
9. Find jobs based on candidates/resumes → market accordingly
10. Job postings for Director/VP/C-Suite → find verified hiring manager contact
11. Put into Instantly campaigns with personalized copy → log everything
12. MPC → follow up through LinkedIn → follow up through email → all recorded, all connected

Steve emphasized: **"Ultimately the goal is not to automate everything, but to work more efficiently, develop better relationships, and make more placements."** and **"I'm an old-school, phone guy... I want to emphasize simplify."**

### CRM Journey

Steve has bounced between CRM options:
- Started with Loxo (current ATS/CRM)
- Considered Zoho (Jan 23)
- Heavily favored PipeDrive (Jan 14) — likes UI simplicity, not recruiting-specific which he sees as a plus
- Also evaluated Stardex, Recruiterflow
- Shawn recommended HubSpot or Attio
- **Status**: Still undecided. Waiting for final decision.

### Data/List Context

- Previous operator (Ruadhan) built Clay tables but everything was jumbled into one big list vs. segmented
- Steve manually separated into Excel sheets (took a long time)
- Main table: "P1-Clay and Loxo Data" — total unseparated list of hiring managers
- Other tables exist with TAM company information
- Shawn's plan: fulfill the master list first, then import into cleaner segmented tables via lookup

### Enrichment Update (Feb 5, Shawn → Steve)

> Previous batch: 6,852 mobiles enriched
> Latest batch: 3,114 fulfilled (4,225 attempted)
> Total: 9,966 contacts with mobile numbers
> Used Lead Magic API and Prospeo API to maximize coverage.
> Deliberately didn't run a validator — validators tend to create false positives.
> Recommended approach: prioritize numbers with highest optimal rates first.
> Next step: Sumble enrichment on full company list (LinkedIn + email).

- Patient but gets antsy after 3+ days without updates
- Prefers text for quick check-ins

- Values simplicity — pushes back on complexity

- Offers quick syncs before full sessions
- Uses Loom for async walkthroughs
- References specific data points (coverage %, row counts)

## Full Conversation Thread

### LinkedIn DMs (Pre-engagement)

Steve found Shawn's LinkedIn post about the AI signal engine. Asked for the signal system resources and about 1:1 consulting. Shawn quoted $200/hr, sent Notion resource page and discovery questionnaire.

### Email: Shawn → Steve (Jan 23)

Sent Miro flowchart and Loom video walkthrough of approach to the data. Included Stripe payment link and Cal.com scheduling link.

### Email: Steve → Shawn (Jan 26)

Questions about:
1. Extent of data enrichment needed and hours estimate
2. Whether Shawn read his goals/notes
3. CRM recommendation (was considering Attio at this point)
4. Billing structure (hourly for calls, work, or both)
5. Emphasized simplicity — "old-school phone guy"

### Email: Shawn → Steve (Jan 26)

- ~40% of table fully enriched, 2-3 hours to maximize coverage
- Miro flowchart is modular/universal, can adjust to Steve's goals
- Recommended Attio over Zoho, HubSpot as upgrade path
- Suggested complimentary 15-min alignment call

### LinkedIn DM: Steve shares tool logins (Jan 28)

Tools with accounts: ZoomInfo, Prospeo, Sumble, Instantly, LeadMagic
**[CREDENTIALS REDACTED — stored in original LinkedIn DM]**

### Email: Shawn → Steve (Feb 5)

Mobile enrichment update. 9,966 contacts with mobile. Recommended prioritization approach. Sumble enrichment next.

### Email: Steve → Shawn (Feb 5)

Asked about email enrichment status (both personal and work). Not sure about Sumble approach — still learning the tool and recruiting technology categories. Available for a call.
