# Tool Consolidation — SteveS Recruiting

## Context

Steve has accumulated many tools, many overlapping. Goal: cut what doesn't serve the workflow, consolidate around fewer tools. Steve emphasized: "I want to simplify, not get caught up in too complex or robust of a tech stack."

## Current Subscriptions (as of Jan 2025)

| Tool | Purpose | Status | Keep / Cut / TBD |
|------|---------|--------|------------------|
| Loxo | ATS/CRM (current) | Active | Cut (replacing with new CRM) |
| LinkedIn Sales Navigator | Prospecting | Active | Keep |
| ZoomInfo | Contact data | Dropping March | Cut |
| Prospeo | Email finding | Active, credits used for enrichment | TBD — may keep for ongoing enrichment |
| FullEnrich | Data enrichment | Active | TBD — evaluate overlap with Prospeo/LeadMagic |
| Clay | Enrichment/tables | Renews March | Keep (Shawn uses for enrichment workflows) |
| ChatGPT | AI assistant | Active | Keep |
| Claude | AI assistant | Active | Keep |
| Primeforge | Unknown | Just started | TBD — evaluate |
| Instantly | Email campaigns | Just started | TBD — Steve is cold call first, may not need |
| Apollo | Contact data | Subscribing when ZoomInfo drops | TBD — evaluate vs. Clay enrichment |
| Sumble | Recruitment tech detection | Just started | Keep (enriching company data for tech stack signals) |
| LeadMagic | Phone/contact enrichment | Active, used for mobile batch | TBD — may keep for ongoing enrichment |

## Recommended Stack (Shawn's Take)

### Core (Must Have)

| Need | Tool | Reasoning |
|------|------|-----------|
| CRM | HubSpot (recommended) | Free tier strong, scales, good imports. Steve debating PipeDrive. |
| Prospecting data | LinkedIn Sales Navigator | Steve already comfortable with it |
| Enrichment platform | Clay | Where the magic happens — enrichment, waterfalls, list management |
| AI assistant | Claude | Already using, powers Lead Alchemy workflows |
| Recruitment signals | Sumble | Detects recruitment software at target companies |

### Likely Cut

| Tool | Why |
|------|-----|
| ZoomInfo | Too expensive for what Steve needs. Apollo or Clay enrichment replaces this. |
| Loxo | Replacing with new CRM |
| FullEnrich | Likely overlaps with Prospeo + LeadMagic through Clay |

### Evaluate

| Tool | Question |
|------|----------|
| Prospeo | Keep if credits are cost-effective for email enrichment. Otherwise Clay waterfalls replace. |
| LeadMagic | Keep if mobile enrichment is ongoing need. Otherwise one-time usage. |
| Apollo | Does Steve need this if Clay handles enrichment? |
| Instantly | Steve is cold call first. Email campaigns are secondary. May not need yet. |
| Primeforge | What does this do for Steve? Evaluate. |

## CRM Decision Matrix

| CRM | Pros | Cons | Steve's Feel | Shawn's Take |
|-----|------|------|-------------|-------------|
| HubSpot | Free tier, scales, Shawn knows it, great import | Heavier UI | Hasn't tried | Recommended |
| PipeDrive | Simple UI, Steve's favorite, sales-focused | Not recruiting-specific (Steve sees as pro) | Strong preference | Acceptable |
| Attio | Clean UI, Clay integration, modern | Smaller ecosystem | Mentioned once | Good option |
| Zoho | All-in-one | Clunky | Considered then scrapped | Not recommended |
| Stardex | Recruiting-specific | Unknown ecosystem | Evaluated | Unknown |
| Recruiterflow | Recruiting-specific | Unknown ecosystem | Evaluated | Unknown |

**Status**: Steve keeps going back and forth. Currently between PipeDrive and HubSpot. Waiting for final decision.

## Migration Plan (Post-Decision)

1. Audit all active subscriptions and monthly costs
2. Cancel clearly redundant tools (ZoomInfo, Loxo)
3. Set up new CRM
4. Map CSV columns to CRM fields
5. Import cleaned master list
6. Set up daily batching views
7. Cancel remaining redundant tools
8. Document final stack in this file
