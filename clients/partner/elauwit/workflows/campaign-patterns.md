# Campaign Patterns — Elauwit

## Validated Plays (Q1 2026)

### Play 1: The Executive Thread

**What**: President/CTO sends hyper-personalized email referencing a specific property, asking to "quote the switch" on their WiFi infrastructure.

**When to use**: Tier 1 economic buyers (Owner, Managing Partner, Principal)

**Why it works**:
1. Authority bias — C-level sender validates the prospect
2. Property + unit count specificity — proves this isn't a blast
3. "Quote the switch" — commercial intent CTA with tangible output
4. Event layering — secondary hook keeps conversation alive

**Key metrics to track**:
- Reply rate (benchmark against standard SDR sequences)
- Meeting book rate from "quote" requests
- Event question conversion (secondary hook effectiveness)

### Play 2: The Gatekeeper Navigation

**What**: Role-based question ("Who on your team ensures WiFi is a good experience?") sent to non-decision-makers to get internal referrals.

**When to use**: When you have contacts at a target company but not the right decision-maker

**Why it works**:
1. Specific role-based question triggers forwarding behavior
2. Asset specificity (property name + units) legitimizes the inquiry
3. Avoids asking for a meeting — asks for a referral instead

**Key metrics to track**:
- Forward/referral rate
- Quality of referred contact (right persona tier?)
- Time to meeting from referral

### Play 3: Domain Warmup Pipeline

**What**: Structured warmup process for new sender domains/mailboxes before campaign activation.

**When to use**: Every time new domains are purchased or new sender accounts are created

**Process**:
1. Purchase domains
2. Set up mailboxes (2 per domain standard)
3. Begin warmup in Instantly
4. Monitor deliverability metrics
5. Graduate to live sends at warmup threshold

**Current state**:
- Sunsetting 18 CEO/CTO mailboxes (from 18 domains)
- Adding AE accounts: minimum 18 domains / 36 mailboxes, recommended 36 domains / 72 mailboxes
- New domains need full warmup cycle before activation

## Iteration Principles

- **Keep the trust signal**: "(Nasdaq: ELWT)" in first sentence, always
- **Tangible CTAs**: "Quote the switch" > "15 minutes of your time"
- **Property specificity**: Name + unit count, every time
- **Event layering**: Always include a secondary hook
- **Sender authority calibration**: Match sender level to prospect level
