# Elauwit — GTM Operations Skill Tree

1. **Network-as-a-Service (NaaS)**: $0 CapEx retrofit for aging infrastructure. Primary play for Class B properties.
2. **Managed WiFi**: Premium resident experience, smart building readiness. Secondary play for Class A properties.

The "(Nasdaq: ELWT)" trust signal is a proven differentiator in outbound — immediately separates from mom-and-pop MSPs.
