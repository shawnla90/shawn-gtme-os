### Suggested Next Message
Hey Lisa - your Capital Markets lens is actually the most interesting angle for this conversation. When your clients are underwriting multifamily acquisitions in Nashville, is managed WiFi revenue showing up as a line item?

We're seeing more buyers factor connectivity revenue into their pro forma - it's becoming a valuation differentiator, not just an amenity. For sellers, having it in place can meaningfully impact cap rate compression.

Would love to get your take as someone who's seen $1.4B in transactions. Even a quick perspective call would be valuable.
