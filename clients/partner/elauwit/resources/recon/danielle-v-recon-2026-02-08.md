Hey Danielle - Mark-Taylor's reputation for Class-A living is well-known. Quick question: with 33,000+ units and residents who expect premium everything, is the current WiFi experience matching the rest of the Mark-Taylor brand?

We work with operators who want connectivity to be invisible (it just works) rather than a pain point. Happy to share what that looks like at scale if it's worth a conversation.
