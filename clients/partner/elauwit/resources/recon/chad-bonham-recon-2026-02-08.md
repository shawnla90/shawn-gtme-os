**Headline**: VP, Asset Management | Multifamily Value Add | Portfolio Strategy and Capital Execution | Wharton MBA
**Location**: United States (likely Las Vegas/Southern Nevada)

### About
VP of Asset Management at Ovation Co since August 2024. Previously Director of Asset Management at Blue Lake Capital (2022-2024) and VP of Real Estate Asset Management at DWS Group (2019-2022). Wharton MBA. Focused on multifamily value-add, portfolio strategy, and capital execution.

### Recent Activity
- Limited public post activity found

### Key Intel
- Wharton MBA - analytically driven, will respond to data and ROI arguments
- Ovation Co: family-owned, 40 communities, 8,703 units owned, 10,641 units managed - SIGNIFICANT portfolio
- Based in Southern Nevada - 30+ years in multifamily
- Value-add focus - this is the sweet spot for managed WiFi (improving NOI through amenity upgrades)
- Relatively new at Ovation (since Aug 2024) - may be evaluating vendors and making changes
- Previous experience at institutional firms (DWS Group, Blue Lake Capital)

### Personalization Hooks
1. Value-add angle - "With your value-add focus, managed WiFi is one of the highest-ROI amenity upgrades we see - it directly impacts NOI through revenue share + reduces churn"
2. New to Ovation - he's only been there ~18 months, likely still evaluating vendor relationships
3. Portfolio scale - 8,700+ units is a meaningful account, approach with portfolio-level thinking not property-level
4. Wharton MBA - lead with numbers, not marketing speak

### Suggested Next Message
Hey Chad - I know you're focused on value-add execution at Ovation. Quick data point: across our managed WiFi portfolio, operators typically see a $15-25/unit/month NOI lift through revenue share, plus measurable improvement in resident satisfaction scores.

With 8,700+ units, even a pilot at a few properties would give you the data to model portfolio-wide impact. Would that kind of analysis be useful as you evaluate the Ovation portfolio?

Happy to share a case study from a similar-sized operator if helpful.
