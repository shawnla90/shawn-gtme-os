### Personalization Hooks
1. Market data angle - she posts about CRE market data, connect WiFi/connectivity to property performance metrics
2. Multi-market oversight - "You oversee 11 markets - are you seeing consistency in how properties handle resident WiFi across regions?"
3. Award recognition - reference her Women of Influence recognition, shows she's visible in the industry
4. NOTE: Avison Young is a brokerage/services firm, not a direct owner/operator - she may not control WiFi decisions but influences property-level operations through advisory

### Suggested Next Message
Hey Damla - I saw your post on the Chicagoland industrial numbers. Your data-driven approach to the market stood out.

Quick question from someone who thinks about multifamily data: across the 11 markets you oversee, are you seeing operators invest differently in resident connectivity? We're tracking a trend where managed WiFi is becoming a standard spec rather than an amenity add-on.

Would love to get your perspective - even a 10-minute call would be valuable. Congrats on the ConnectCRE recognition, well-deserved.
