3. Professional credentials - she invests in her career development, parallel that with investing in resident experience

### Suggested Next Message
Hey Crystal - I saw your ResMANIA recap and your career story on LinkedIn. Going from Leasing Consultant to VP Ops means you've seen the resident experience from every angle.

That's actually why managed WiFi matters so much to operators like you - it touches every level from leasing (WiFi as an amenity) to operations (fewer resident complaints) to renewals (connectivity drives satisfaction scores).

Are you heading to any conferences this year? Would love to connect in person and show you what LUMA's residents would actually experience with Elauwit.
