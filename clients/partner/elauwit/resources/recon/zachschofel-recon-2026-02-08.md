3. Tech-shaping-multifamily angle - reference the Innovation Blueprint video, connect WiFi/connectivity as another tech layer for his portfolio

### Suggested Next Message
Hey Zach - I caught your Innovation Blueprint interview on tech shaping multifamily investments. Building Cosign while running 2,500+ units tells me you think about the resident experience from every angle.

That's exactly why I wanted to reconnect. Elauwit's managed WiFi is another layer of that resident-first approach - and the data we can surface on usage, satisfaction, and retention maps directly to the NOI impact you care about.

Are you attending the Carolinas Middle-Market Multifamily conference in Charlotte this October? I'll be there - would be great to connect in person.
