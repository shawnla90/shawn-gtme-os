Hey Eva - as a Property Manager, you probably deal with resident WiFi complaints more than you'd like. It's one of those things that shouldn't take up your time, but it does.

With managed WiFi through Elauwit, that entire problem goes away - residents get reliable connectivity, and your team gets fewer calls. Would it be worth a quick chat to see if it could help at your property?
