### Personalization Hooks
1. Hotel management background - "Your hospitality background tells me you think about the resident experience differently. In hotels, WiFi is non-negotiable. Why should apartments be different?"
2. Renovation/repositioning focus - managed WiFi is a repositioning play that adds value during renovation
3. Bell Partners connection - "I noticed you and Dave Andrews (who I'm also connected with) both came through Bell Partners. Small world in multifamily."
4. California focus - any Elauwit California case studies would be highly relevant

### Suggested Next Message
Hey Tessi - your hospitality background at Johnson & Wales caught my eye. In hotels, reliable WiFi is table stakes - guests expect it. We're seeing the same expectation shift in multifamily.

With Davlyn's renovation and repositioning strategy, managed WiFi is one of those upgrades that pays for itself: it creates a new revenue line, reduces resident complaints, and makes the property feel more modern during lease-up after a reposition.

Would it be worth exploring for any of Davlyn's upcoming renovation projects? Happy to share what we're seeing work in the California market specifically.
