2. Hines Living brand - Hines positions their living properties as premium; Elauwit's managed WiFi aligns with that brand promise
3. West Coast focus - mention any Elauwit West Coast installations or SF-specific references

### Suggested Next Message
Hey Annalyn - I saw you're building the team at 855 Brannan. Staffing a 400-unit property in SF is no small task, so I know your plate is full.

Quick thought: one thing we see with premium communities like Hines' Living properties is that managed WiFi removes a whole category of resident complaints from your team's plate. No more "my internet is down" calls to your leasing and maintenance teams.

Would it be worth a 15-min call to see if there's a fit for any of the Hines Living West Coast properties? Happy to work around your timeline.
