### About
VP of Maintenance at Bell Partners Inc. Limited public information available.

### Recent Activity
- No public posts found

### Key Intel
- Bell Partners: major multifamily operator, 85,000+ homes across 13 states + DC, 2,000 associates
- VP of Maintenance = controls the operational infrastructure decisions (including connectivity/WiFi hardware)
- Based in Florida but Bell Partners operates nationally
- Maintenance VP is actually a KEY contact for WiFi - they deal with the physical infrastructure, resident complaints about connectivity, and vendor relationships for building systems
- Tessi Dahlen (another accepted connection) previously worked at Bell Partners

### Personalization Hooks
1. Maintenance angle - "As VP of Maintenance, you're probably the person who hears about WiFi issues first. Managed WiFi eliminates those calls from your team's plate entirely."
2. Bell Partners scale - 85,000 homes is massive, even a pilot conversation has huge upside
3. Cross-connection with Tessi Dahlen - both came through Bell Partners
4. Florida base - any Elauwit Florida installations as social proof

### Suggested Next Message
Hey Dave - as VP of Maintenance at Bell Partners, I'm guessing connectivity issues show up on your radar more than most people realize. Residents call maintenance when their WiFi drops, even when it's not a building issue.

With managed WiFi, that entire category of complaints goes away. Your maintenance teams focus on actual maintenance, not troubleshooting ISP problems.

Across 85,000+ homes, even a small reduction in connectivity-related work orders adds up fast. Would it be worth a quick conversation about what that looks like at scale?
