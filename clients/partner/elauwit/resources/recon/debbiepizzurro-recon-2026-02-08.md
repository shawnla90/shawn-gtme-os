### Personalization Hooks
1. New development angle - "For your new developments, are you designing connectivity into the building from day one? We're seeing more developers spec managed WiFi pre-construction"
2. 40-year career at Oakwood - incredible loyalty, reference respect for building something lasting
3. Lease-up expertise - WiFi as a lease-up amenity that accelerates absorption

### Suggested Next Message
Hey Debbie - 40 years building Oakwood from the inside is remarkable. Your new development expertise caught my attention because we're seeing a shift: developers are now spec'ing managed WiFi into properties pre-construction rather than retrofitting after.

For lease-up specifically, having day-one WiFi removes a friction point for new residents moving in - they're connected before the boxes are unpacked.

Is that something you'd consider for upcoming Oakwood developments? Happy to share what we're seeing work in new construction.
