- Posts about leasing commission structures and on-site team incentive alignment
- Portfolio across Nashville, Myrtle Beach, Savannah, and emerging markets

**Why he matters:** Tech-forward operator who builds proptech AND runs a portfolio. He thinks about resident experience as a system, not just an amenity checklist.

**Hook:** Reference his Innovation Blueprint interview + Cosign + Carolinas conference

**Suggested Message:**
> Hey Zach - I caught your Innovation Blueprint interview on tech shaping multifamily investments. Building Cosign while running 2,500+ units tells me you think about the resident experience from every angle.
>
> That's exactly why I wanted to reconnect. Elauwit's managed WiFi is another layer of that resident-first approach - and the data we can surface on usage, satisfaction, and retention maps directly to the NOI impact you care about.
>
> Are you attending the Carolinas Middle-Market Multifamily conference in Charlotte this October? I'll be there - would be great to connect in person.

**Hook:** Reference ResMANIA + career journey from every angle of property ops

**Suggested Message:**
> Hey Crystal - I saw your ResMANIA recap and your career story on LinkedIn. Going from Leasing Consultant to VP Ops means you've seen the resident experience from every angle.
>
> That's actually why managed WiFi matters so much to operators like you - it touches every level from leasing (WiFi as an amenity) to operations (fewer resident complaints) to renewals (connectivity drives satisfaction scores).

### 3. Annalyn Chacon - Hines
**Priority**: HIGHEST | **Activity Level**: Medium

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|

- Hines Living is their premium residential/multifamily division
- Oversees U.S. West living portfolio for one of the world's largest real estate firms

**Hook:** 855 Brannan hiring + Hines premium brand expectations

**Suggested Message:**
> Hey Annalyn - I saw you're building the team at 855 Brannan. Staffing a 400-unit property in SF is no small task, so I know your plate is full.
>
> Quick thought: one thing we see with premium communities like Hines' Living properties is that managed WiFi removes a whole category of resident complaints from your team's plate. No more "my internet is down" calls to your leasing and maintenance teams.
>
> Would it be worth a 15-min call to see if there's a fit for any of the Hines Living West Coast properties? Happy to work around your timeline.

### 4. Debbie Pizzurro - Oakwood Management
**Priority**: HIGHEST | **Activity Level**: Medium

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Title | Vice President, New Development |
| Company | Oakwood Management Company |
| Location | Columbus, Ohio |
| Profile | [linkedin.com/in/debbiepizzurro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/debbiepizzurro) |
| Email | dcaps@liveoakwood.com |
| Credentials | CPM, CAPS, Licensed Real Estate Professional |
| Sequence Stage | Breakup sent (4/4 messages) |

- **40 years at Oakwood** (since 1986!) - Leasing Consultant to VP
- Leads **new development** from project inception through development and lease-up
- IREM member, Columbus Apartment Association active member
- University of Akron grad

**Why she matters:** She controls what goes INTO new buildings from day one. If managed WiFi is spec'd pre-construction, it's baked in permanently.

**Hook:** New development = spec WiFi pre-construction + 40-year Oakwood legacy

**Suggested Message:**
> Hey Debbie - 40 years building Oakwood from the inside is remarkable. Your new development expertise caught my attention because we're seeing a shift: developers are now spec'ing managed WiFi into properties pre-construction rather than retrofitting after.
>
> For lease-up specifically, having day-one WiFi removes a friction point for new residents moving in - they're connected before the boxes are unpacked.
>
> Is that something you'd consider for upcoming Oakwood developments? Happy to share what we're seeing work in new construction.

| Connection requests sent | 280 |
| **Connections accepted** | **11 (3.6%)** |

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Send personalized messages** to the 4 sequence-exhausted contacts (Zach, Crystal, Annalyn, Debbie) using the suggested messages above - these are fresh angles, not template continuations
2. **Hold on mid-sequence contacts** until their automated breakup message goes out, then follow up with personalized messages
3. **Consider email outreach via Instantly** as a parallel channel for the 9 contacts with email addresses on file
4. **Conference networking**: Sebastian mentioned attending Bisnow, IMN, InterFace - Zach Schofel is confirmed speaking at IMN Carolinas in October. Flag that as an in-person opportunity.
5. **Cross-sell the Bell Partners connection**: Both Dave Andrews (current) and Tessi Dahlen (former) have Bell Partners ties. If either engages, reference the other.
