Hey Tom, who on your team ensures WiFi is a good experience for residents?

I’d like to earn the opportunity to quote the “switch to Elauwit” for The Village at Gracy Farms's 308 units. And any property that may benefit from an upgraded Managed WiFi experience.

Also, are you attending any industry events this year? Happy to skip the messages and grab 10 minutes in-person if so. Hope to see you around.

Hi Tom!

I’m with Elauwit (Nasdaq: ELWT), we’re a publicly-traded connectivity MSP purpose-built for multifamily. Any idea when the WiFi agreement for The Village at Gracy Farms is set to renew?

If it’s worth exploring, we can quote the switch to Elauwit for 308 units?
