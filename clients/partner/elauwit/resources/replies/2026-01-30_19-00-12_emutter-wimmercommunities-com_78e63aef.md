Subject: Quick question about The Club at Brookfield Hills WiFi

Hi Ellen!

I’m with Elauwit (Nasdaq: ELWT), we’re a publicly-traded connectivity MSP purpose-built for multifamily. Any idea when the WiFi agreement for The Club at Brookfield Hills is set to renew?

If it’s worth exploring, we can quote the switch to Elauwit for 311 units?
