Subject: Quick question about Woodward Estates WiFi

Hi Edmund!

I’m with Elauwit (Nasdaq: ELWT), we’re a publicly-traded connectivity MSP purpose-built for multifamily. Any idea when the WiFi agreement for Woodward Estates is set to renew?

If it’s worth exploring, we can quote the switch to Elauwit for 265 units?
