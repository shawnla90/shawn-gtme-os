# Campaign Copy — Elauwit

## Proven Sequences (Q1 2026)

### Sequence 1: "Quote the Switch" (Executive Thread)

**Context**: Used by Taylor Jones (President & CTO) persona. Secured direct meeting with high-level decision-maker.

**Why it works**:
- **Authority bias**: President/CTO sender validates prospect's status
- **Hyper-relevance**: References specific property name + exact unit count
- **Commercial intent**: "Quote the switch" signals clear business purpose, not just discovery
- **Event anchor**: Industry events question as secondary hook to lower friction

**Subject Line**: `Re: Quick question about [Property Name] WiFi`

**Touch 1 (The Hook)**:
```

```

**Touch 2 (The Threaded Follow-Up)**:
```
[POPULATE: Insert validated Touch 2 copy]
```

**Key elements to preserve**:
- "(Nasdaq: ELWT)" in first sentence — trust signal, proven differentiator
- Specific property name + unit count — proves research
- "Quote the switch" CTA — outperforms "15 minutes of time"
- Event question as fallback hook

### Sequence 2: "Gatekeeper Navigation"

**Context**: Used to get internal referrals from non-decision-makers to the right stakeholder.

**Why it works**:
- **Role-based ask**: "Who on your team ensures WiFi is a good experience?" — prompts forwarding instead of deletion
- **Asset specificity**: Naming a specific property (e.g., "DREAM Kissimmee, 304 units") treats email as legitimate business inquiry

**Copy Template**:
```
[POPULATE: Insert validated Gatekeeper Navigation copy]
```

## Copy Rules

1. Always include "(Nasdaq: ELWT)" in first touch — non-negotiable trust signal
2. Always reference a specific property by name + unit count
3. Use "quote the switch" or similar tangible-output CTA, never "15 minutes"
4. Layer event questions as secondary hooks
5. Property details must be accurate — wrong unit counts kill credibility

## Sender Personas (Current)

### Sunsetting (Q1 2026)
- CEO/CTO personas — being retired from sends

### Active
- SDR personas — primary senders going forward

### Incoming
- 2 new AE accounts — will need new sequences calibrated for AE authority level

## Campaign Segmentation Notes

- **NaaS campaigns**: Target Tier 2 ops personas at Class B properties
- **Managed WiFi campaigns**: Target development personas at Class A properties
- **Executive Thread**: Reserve for Tier 1 economic buyers only
- **Gatekeeper Navigation**: Use on Tier 2 contacts who aren't decision-makers but can refer
