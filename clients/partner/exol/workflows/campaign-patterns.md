# Campaign Patterns — Exol (GreenBox)

## 3 Outbound Plays + 2 Inbound Channels

### Outbound Play 1: "3PL Switcher"

**What**: Target companies showing signs of outgrowing their current 3PL

**Target persona**: Strategic Sam (VP/Director Supply Chain)

**Sequence tool**: Smartlead

**Key metrics**:
- Signal-to-reply rate
- Meeting conversion by signal type
- Displacement rate (did they actually switch?)

### Outbound Play 2: "Tech Stack Friction"

**What**: Target tech-savvy ops leaders whose modern stack doesn't integrate with their legacy 3PL

**Signal triggers**:
- Shopify/Shopify Plus usage confirmed
- Gorgias or support tool usage (WISMO indicator)
- Integration-related job postings or forum complaints

**Target persona**: Ops Olivia (Director Ecommerce Ops)

**Key metrics**:
- Tech stack match rate
- Engagement by tech stack combination

### Outbound Play 3: "Funding Trigger"

**What**: Target recently funded companies (Series B-D) who need to scale fulfillment

**Signal triggers**:
- Funding announcement (Crunchbase, press)
- Rapid headcount growth
- Scale-up job postings

**Target persona**: Scale-Minded Shawn (COO/EVP)

**Key metrics**:
- Time from funding announcement to outreach

### Inbound: Paid Media (Atlanta Launch)

**Channels**: Google Ads + LinkedIn Ads
**Focus**: Atlanta 3PL launch, automation-first messaging
**Goal**: Waitlist for new facility (opening 2026)
**Targeting**: Supply chain / logistics / ops leaders in target verticals

### Inbound: Content & SEO

**Pillars**:
1. Automated Fulfillment — what, how, ROI
2. Tech-Enabled Infrastructure — integrations, AI, visibility
3. Compliance-Driven Execution — OTIF, chargebacks, automation

**SEO targets**: "3PL automation," "OTIF delivery," "automated fulfillment," "warehouse-as-a-service"

## Cross-Partner Pattern Notes

- **Trust signal pattern**: Elauwit uses "(Nasdaq: ELWT)", GreenBox uses "$7.5B Symbotic partnership" — same function, different proof point
- **Signal-triggered outreach**: All three partners benefit from signal-based plays (Elauwit: property pain, Connext: ESL/remodels, GreenBox: 3PL reviews/funding)
- **Executive Thread**: Adaptable across all three partners with persona-tier calibration
