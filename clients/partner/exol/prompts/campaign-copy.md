# Campaign Copy — Exol (GreenBox)

## Email Tool: Smartlead (Not Instantly)

GreenBox uses Smartlead for outbound email campaigns, not Instantly.

## Copy Framework by Play

### Play 1: "3PL Switcher"

**Target**: Companies outgrowing current 3PL provider
**Persona**: Strategic Sam
**Angle**: Your 3PL can't scale — capital-free automation exists now

**Key messaging elements**:
- Reference their current 3PL pain (if discoverable)
- "$7.5B Symbotic partnership" as credibility signal
- "Pay-as-you-go" vs. rigid contracts
- OTIF improvement as measurable outcome
- No CapEx framing

**Sequence**:
```
[TO BE DEVELOPED — anchor to 3PL displacement + automation ROI]
```

### Play 2: "Tech Stack Friction"

**Target**: Tech-savvy ops leaders hitting integration limits
**Persona**: Ops Olivia
**Angle**: Your tech stack is modern — your fulfillment shouldn't be manual

**Key messaging elements**:
- Reference their Shopify/tech stack (prove research)
- WISMO reduction as measurable outcome
- GreenBox Fulfillment AI integration story
- Real-time visibility vs. black box 3PL

**Sequence**:
```
[TO BE DEVELOPED — anchor to Shopify integration + visibility]
```

### Play 3: "Funding Trigger"

**Target**: Recently funded Series B-D companies
**Persona**: Scale-Minded Shawn
**Angle**: You raised to scale — don't burn it on warehouse CapEx

**Key messaging elements**:
- Reference their funding round (specific amount if public)
- Consumption-based pricing vs. $100M warehouse build
- Speed to scale (GreenBox network is already built)
- Risk reduction narrative

**Sequence**:
```
[TO BE DEVELOPED — anchor to funding + CapEx avoidance]
```

## Copy Rules

1. Always anchor to a specific play — no generic "we do fulfillment" outreach
2. Lead with their pain, not GreenBox's features
3. "$7.5B Symbotic partnership" is the trust signal (equivalent to Elauwit's Nasdaq ticker)
4. "Capital-free" and "pay-as-you-go" are the differentiators — use them
5. Persona-specific language: cost-per-order for Sam, WISMO for Olivia, CapEx for Shawn
