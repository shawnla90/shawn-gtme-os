# Exol (GreenBox) ICP

## Target Market

Companies "trapped" between manual legacy 3PLs and the prohibitive cost of building their own automated warehouses. GreenBox sits in the gap — enterprise automation without the CapEx.

## Primary Verticals

### 1. Mid-Market CPG & F&B (Primary Target)

- **Revenue**: $50M–$500M
- **Why they fit**: Large enough to face retail compliance fines (OTIF) but too small for self-automation
- **Pain**: Manual 3PLs can't scale, OTIF chargebacks eating margin, $100M+ automation is out of reach

### 2. Retailers (Omni-Channel)

- **Need**: Faster store replenishment + 2-day DTC delivery
- **Why they fit**: Omni-channel complexity requires automation to keep up
- **Pain**: Inventory sync across channels, fulfillment speed expectations

### 3. Large CPG & F&B (Enterprise)

- **Use case**: Overflow capacity or risk reduction from labor volatility
- **Why they fit**: Already have some automation but need flexible surge capacity
- **Pain**: Peak season scaling, labor shortages, single-point-of-failure risk

### 4. Wholesalers / Distributors

- **Use case**: Optimizing inbound supply chains and store distribution
- **Why they fit**: High volume, repetitive fulfillment patterns ideal for automation
- **Pain**: Manual processes at scale, error rates, labor costs

## Qualification Criteria

A qualified Exol/GreenBox target meets:
- [ ] In a target vertical (CPG, F&B, Retail, Wholesale/Distribution)
- [ ] Revenue $50M+ (sweet spot $50M–$500M for mid-market, larger for enterprise overflow)
- [ ] Currently using a manual or semi-automated 3PL (or considering switching)
- [ ] Faces at least one core pain: OTIF fines, labor scaling issues, CapEx barriers, fulfillment speed gaps
- [ ] US-based operations (Atlanta facility first)

## Disqualifiers

- Already fully automated in-house (no outsourcing need)
- Too small to have retail compliance exposure (<$50M revenue)
- No physical product fulfillment needs
- International-only operations (no US fulfillment need yet)
