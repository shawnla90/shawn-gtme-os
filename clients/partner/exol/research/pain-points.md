# Customer Pain Points — Exol (GreenBox)

## Core Pain Points

### 1. Manual Labor Scaling
- Current 3PLs rely on manual labor that cannot scale during peaks
- Labor shortages hit hardest during holiday/seasonal surges
- Error rates spike when manual teams are stretched
- **Signal**: Hiring for fulfillment roles, negative 3PL reviews mentioning capacity

### 2. Retail Compliance Fines (OTIF)
- Brands are suffering chargebacks from missed On-Time In-Full (OTIF) targets
- Retail partners (Walmart, Target, etc.) enforce strict compliance with financial penalties
- Manual fulfillment can't consistently hit OTIF thresholds
- **Signal**: Companies in retail-facing CPG, F&B with compliance exposure

### 3. CapEx Barriers
- Companies want automation but cannot afford $100M+ to build their own facilities
- The "build vs. buy" decision is paralyzing — WaaS removes it entirely
- Even large enterprises face internal pushback on warehouse CapEx
- **Signal**: Companies evaluating automation but not breaking ground, "exploring options"

### 4. Lack of Visibility (Black Box Logistics)
- Legacy 3PLs operate as "black boxes" — brands can't see inventory status
- No predictive capability — problems discovered after they happen
- GreenBox Fulfillment AI solves this with real-time visibility and predictive compliance
- **Signal**: Companies complaining about 3PL reporting, seeking visibility tools

### 5. WISMO Tickets (Where Is My Order)
- High customer service costs from shipping delays and lack of data syncing
- Caused by inventory out of sync between Shopify/ERPs and 3PL systems
- Kills customer experience and increases support headcount
- **Signal**: DTC brands with Shopify, high return rates, Gorgias/support tool usage
