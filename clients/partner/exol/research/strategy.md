# Exol (GreenBox) Strategy & Roadmap

## GTM Strategy: Foundational Build → Targeted Outbound + Inbound

### Phase 1: Outbound Plays (Clay & Smartlead)

Three signal-triggered outbound plays:

#### Play 1: "3PL Switcher"
- **Target**: Companies outgrowing their current 3PL provider
- **Signals**:
  - Negative reviews of ShipBob, Flexe, or similar providers
  - Hiring for fulfillment roles (sign they're trying to solve in-house)
  - Social posts complaining about 3PL performance
- **Persona**: Strategic Sam
- **Angle**: "Your 3PL can't scale — here's what capital-free automation looks like"

#### Play 2: "Tech Stack Friction"
- **Target**: Tech-savvy ops leaders hitting integration limits
- **Signals**:
  - Using Shopify, Gorgias, but facing integration issues with 3PL
  - Job postings for "logistics tech" or "supply chain systems" roles
  - Forum/community posts about fulfillment tool stack pain
- **Persona**: Ops Olivia
- **Angle**: "Your tech stack is modern — your fulfillment shouldn't be manual"

#### Play 3: "Funding Trigger"
- **Target**: Recently funded companies (Series B-D) needing to scale infrastructure
- **Signals**:
  - Recent funding announcement (Crunchbase, press)
  - Rapid headcount growth
  - Job postings indicating scale-up phase
- **Persona**: Scale-Minded Shawn
- **Angle**: "You just raised to scale — don't burn it on warehouse CapEx"

### Phase 2: Paid Media (Atlanta Launch)

- **Channels**: Google Ads + LinkedIn Ads
- **Focus**: Atlanta 3PL launch + "Automation-First" messaging
- **Goal**: Build waitlist for new facility (opening 2026)
- **Targeting**: Supply chain / logistics / ops leaders in target verticals

### Phase 3: Content & Thought Leadership

**Content Pillars**:
1. **Automated Fulfillment** — what it looks like, how it works, ROI
2. **Tech-Enabled Infrastructure** — integrations, visibility, Fulfillment AI
3. **Compliance-Driven Execution** — OTIF, chargebacks, how automation fixes compliance

**SEO Targets**: "3PL automation," "OTIF delivery," "automated fulfillment," "warehouse-as-a-service"
