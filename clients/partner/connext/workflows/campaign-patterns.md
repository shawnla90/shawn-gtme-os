# Campaign Patterns — Connext

## Current State

Pre-campaign phase. Building foundation (TAM, TAL, qualification) before scaling outbound.

## Planned Plays

### Play 1: Solution-Led Direct Outreach

**What**: Lead with a specific Solution Play relevant to the target's vertical and signals, not generic "we do deployments."

**When to use**: Tier 1 (Champion) and Tier 2 (Ops Gatekeeper) contacts at validated 100+ location companies

**Structure**:
1. Identify which Solution Play fits (based on vertical + signals)
2. Reference specific location count and relevant pain point
3. "First-visit success" as differentiator
4. Bridge to managed services (ARR layer)

### Play 2: Signal-Triggered Outreach

**What**: Triggered by high-intent signals — ESL adoption, remodel announcements, IT layoffs

**When to use**: When a signal fires on a qualified account

**Why it should work**:
- Timeliness — reaching out when the need is active
- Relevance — referencing their specific initiative
- Urgency — deployment needs have deadlines

### Play 3: Executive Thread (Adapted from Elauwit)

**What**: Senior Connext leader reaches out to Tier 4 Executive Sponsors

**When to use**: Large enterprise targets where SDR outreach won't land

**Key differences from Elauwit version**:
- No stock ticker trust signal — use scale metrics instead (e.g., "deployed at X sites nationally")
- Solution Play framing instead of product-specific
- Refresh cycle hook instead of "quote the switch"

### Play 4: Refresh Cycle Re-engagement

**What**: Target companies approaching their 12–36 month tech refresh window

**When to use**: Accounts where refresh timing is known or estimable

**Why it should work**:
- Captures accounts at decision point
- Positions Connext as the "Powering Your Next" partner
- Natural ARR upsell opportunity

## Iteration Notes

- All plays are pre-validation — document what works once campaigns launch
- Cross-reference with Elauwit patterns that may transfer (Executive Thread, Gatekeeper Navigation)
- Solution Play selection should be data-driven: which play converts best in which vertical?
