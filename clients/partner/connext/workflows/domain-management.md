# Domain Management — Connext

## Current Infrastructure (Q1 2026)

### Active
- **Mailboxes**: 2 (very limited)
- **Campaign capacity**: Minimal — not ready for scaled outbound

### Planned Expansion
- Expansion scope TBD
- Need to match infrastructure to TAM size before scaling
- Follow Elauwit domain management patterns for setup process

## Expansion Recommendations

Based on Elauwit patterns:
- Minimum 2 mailboxes per domain
- Start with enough capacity for initial campaign testing
- Scale as TAM is validated and sequences are proven

## When to Expand

Don't scale email infrastructure until:
- [ ] Full TAM identified and validated
- [ ] Location count validation Claygent operational
- [ ] TAL built and segmented
- [ ] At least one sequence drafted and reviewed
- [ ] Sender personas defined (SDR vs. AE vs. Executive)

## Setup Process

Reference: [`../../elauwit/workflows/domain-management.md`](../elauwit/workflows/domain-management.md) for the full domain purchase → warmup → graduation → monitoring workflow.
