# Campaign Copy — Connext

## Current State

Early stage — only 2 mailboxes purchased. Campaign copy is in development, not yet validated at scale.

## Copy Framework

### Lead with Solution Plays, Not Generic Labor

Every sequence should anchor to one of the 5 Solution Plays:
1. National Multi-Site Deployment
2. Digital Signage
3. Structured Cabling
4. Staging & Logistics
5. Remote Workforce

### Messaging Principles

- **"First-visit success"** — Connext's core differentiator, use in every sequence
- **Location count specificity** — reference their actual site count to prove research
- **NRR→ARR bridge** — frame as "deploy AND manage," not just "deploy"
- **Refresh cycle hook** — "we're not just here for this rollout"
- **Pain-specific openers** — lead with their specific tension (see pain-points.md)

### Persona-Tier Calibration

| Persona Tier | Messaging Focus | CTA Style |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Tier 1 (Champion) | Consistency, downtime elimination | "Walk through how we handle [specific challenge]" |
| Tier 2 (Ops Gatekeeper) | Site readiness, first-visit success | "How are you handling [upcoming rollout]?" |
| Tier 4 (Executive Sponsor) | Strategic alignment, vendor consolidation | Executive Thread approach |

## Sequences (To Be Built)

### Sequence 1: Solution-Led Intro
```
[TO BE DEVELOPED — anchor to specific Solution Play + location count + pain point]
```

### Sequence 2: Signal-Triggered
```
[TO BE DEVELOPED — triggered by ESL, remodel, or IT layoff signals]
```

### Sequence 3: Refresh Cycle
```
[TO BE DEVELOPED — "when was your last network refresh?" approach]
```

## Sender Personas

### Current
- 2 mailboxes (limited sendability)

### Planned
- Expansion needed before scaling campaigns
- Match sender authority to prospect tier (SDR → Tier 1/2, Executive → Tier 4)
