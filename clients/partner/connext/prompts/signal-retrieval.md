# Signal Retrieval — Connext

## Purpose

Key signals to enrich and monitor for Connext target accounts. Used in Clay tables, Claygent enrichments, and ongoing monitoring.

## High-Intent Signals (Priority)

### Electronic Shelf Labels (ESL)
- **Why**: Indicates complex IoT deployment needs — exactly Connext's wheelhouse
- **Where to find**: Press releases, trade publications, investor presentations
- **Signal strength**: Very high

### Remodeling / Modernization Programs
- **Why**: Store refreshes require new technology rollouts (cabling, POS, signage)
- **Where to find**: Public announcements, SEC filings, news articles (e.g., "Sam's Club renovation")
- **Signal strength**: Very high

### Return to Core Operations / IT Layoffs
- **Why**: Company reducing internal IT signals readiness to outsource deployment
- **Where to find**: Layoff announcements, restructuring news, job posting reductions
- **Signal strength**: High

### Tech Refresh Cycle Indicators
- **Why**: 12–36 month refresh cadences mean recurring deployment needs
- **Where to find**: Industry benchmarks, vendor contract timelines, annual reports
- **Signal strength**: High

## Company-Level Signals

### Must-Have

### Enrichment Signals

## Person-Level Signals

### For Enrichment
- **Job title match**: Against 6-tier persona hierarchy (see personas.md)

- **Specific location count**: "We noticed your 340 locations across 28 states"
- **Recent announcements**: Remodel programs, tech investments
- **Event attendance**: NRF, MURTEC, industry-specific conferences

## Monitoring Signals (Ongoing)

- Public remodel/modernization announcements
- ESL adoption signals in target verticals
- IT restructuring or outsourcing news
- New store openings (expanding footprint = more deployment need)
