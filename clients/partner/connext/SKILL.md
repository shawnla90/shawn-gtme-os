# Connext — GTM Operations Skill Tree

## Company Overview

**Connext** designs, deploys, and manages technology at scale for large multi-site enterprises. Not a labor broker — a strategic partner that ensures "First-visit success."

**Two business segments**:
1. **Deployment (NRR)**: Large-scale rollouts — structured cabling, network installation, POS systems, physical security
2. **Managed Services (ARR)**: Post-deployment — 24/7 monitoring, "Smart Hands" break/fix, "Technician as a Service" (TaaS)

**Strategic pivot**: "Powering Your Next" — transitioning from partner-led to Direct Sales, shifting revenue mix from 75% NRR to healthy NRR/ARR balance. Every deployment should layer in a managed services contract.
