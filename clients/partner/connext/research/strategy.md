# Connext Strategy — "Powering Your Next"

## The Strategic Pivot

Connext is transitioning from a **partner-led model** to a **Direct Sales motion**. "Powering Your Next" is the cultural rally cry driving this transformation.

### Revenue Mix Shift

- **Current**: ~75% Deployment (NRR) / ~25% Managed Services (ARR)
- **Target**: Healthy balance of NRR and ARR
- **How**: "Embed managed services everywhere" — every deployment project layers in a managed services contract

### The Motion

1. **Land with Design & Deployment** (NRR) — where Connext has strongest track record
2. **Immediately expand into Managed Services** (ARR) — monitoring, break/fix, TaaS
3. **Capture the refresh cycle** — become the incumbent for the next rollout (12–36 months)

## The Bowtie Data Model

Redefines the revenue lifecycle to track what happens after the initial sale:

| Stage | Type | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| Closed NRR | One-time | Project revenue from deployment |
| Closed MRR | Recurring | Monthly recurring from managed services |
| LTV | Lifetime | Renewal + cross-sell value |
| Renewal Events | Automated | Contract end dates trigger new opportunities |

### Lifecycle Stages (Pipeline Rigor)

- **MQL** → Marketing Qualified
- **SAL** → SDR Verified
- **SQL** → AE Qualified
- **Opportunity** → Requires Timeline + Decision Maker (hard entry criteria)

### "Pig in the Python" Fix

Deals were stalling in "Proposal Sent." Fix: strict entry/exit criteria for Opportunity stage requiring confirmed Timeline and identified Decision Maker.

## 5 Solution Plays

Sales leads with specific solution plays, not generic labor:

### 1. National Multi-Site Deployment (The Anchor)
- **NRR**: Cabling, install, turn-up
- **ARR Layer**: Break/fix support, proactive site health monitoring, refresh cycle management

### 2. Digital Signage (High Growth)
- **NRR**: Physical installation and wiring
- **ARR Layer**: 24/7 uptime monitoring, RMA/sparing programs, content push coordination

### 3. Structured Cabling (The Foundation)
- **NRR**: Infrastructure build-out
- **ARR Layer**: Maintenance, testing, upgrade management

### 4. Staging & Logistics (The Differentiator)
- **NRR**: Pre-configuration and kit staging
- **ARR Layer**: Inventory management, swap-out logistics

### 5. Remote Workforce (The Emerging Segment)
- **NRR**: Provisioning remote kits and edge connectivity
- **ARR Layer**: Remote device monitoring, VPN/VOIP management, rapid swap-out

## Messaging Implications

- Every campaign should lead with a **Solution Play**, not "we do deployments"
- Always frame the NRR→ARR bridge: "deploy AND manage"
- Use "Powering Your Next" narrative to position Connext as permanent execution engine, not one-time vendor
- The refresh cycle (12–36 months) is the hook for ARR: "we're not just here for this rollout"
