# Total Addressable Market — Connext

## TAM Definition

The full universe of companies that meet Connext's ICP criteria:
- $500M+ revenue
- 100+ physical locations in North America
- In a key vertical (retail, QSR, grocery, financial services, healthcare)
- Lean internal IT (outsourcing need)

## TAM Identification Process

### Step 1: Universe Build
- Source from databases (LinkedIn Sales Navigator, ZoomInfo, Clay enrichment)
- Filter by revenue ($500M+) and industry vertical
- Cast wide net — validate location count in Step 2

### Step 2: Location Count Validation (Hard Gate)
- Use Claygent to scrape company websites for store locator pages
- Cross-reference with third-party data (Google Maps, Yelp, industry databases)
- Validate 100+ locations — this is the pass/fail gate
- Log location count as a data point for segmentation

### Step 3: Qualification Enrichment
- Confirm privately held or public (both valid for Connext)
- Check for lean IT signals (small IT team relative to company size)
- Identify current technology vendors (competitive intelligence)
- Flag high-intent signals (ESL, remodels, IT layoffs)

### Step 4: TAL (Target Account List) Build
- Qualified accounts from TAM → TAL
- Segment by vertical, geography, and signal strength
- Prioritize by: signal density > location count > revenue
