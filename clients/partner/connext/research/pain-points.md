# Customer Pain Points — Connext

## Core Tensions for Distributed Enterprises

### 1. Deployment Pressure
Technology moves fast, but physical deployment is slow and chaotic. Companies need to roll out new tech across hundreds of sites simultaneously but lack the execution muscle.

### 2. Refresh Cycles
Managing upgrades every 12–36 months across thousands of sites. Every cycle is a new project that requires national coordination. This is also Connext's ARR wedge — capture the relationship during the first refresh, own every subsequent one.

### 3. Labor Shortages
Inability to staff internal teams to cover national footprints. Even large enterprises can't maintain deployment teams in every market. Outsourcing to a national partner becomes the only viable option.

### 4. Downtime Risk
Fear that a failed install will disrupt store operations and revenue. A botched POS install at 500 locations doesn't just cost rework — it costs revenue. "First-visit success" directly addresses this fear.

### 5. Inconsistency
Irregular store readiness, rework, and the "second truck roll" problem. When deployments aren't standardized, every site is a different experience. The second truck roll (going back to fix what should have been done right) is a massive cost and credibility killer.

## Pain Point → Solution Play Mapping

| Pain Point | Solution Play | Messaging Angle |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| Deployment pressure | National Multi-Site Deployment | "Scale without scrambling" |
| Refresh cycles | Managed Services (ARR) | "Powering your next refresh, not just this one" |
| Labor shortages | TaaS / Smart Hands | "Your national IT team without the headcount" |
| Downtime risk | First-visit success | "Right the first time, every site" |
| Inconsistency | Staging & Logistics | "Same experience, site 1 through site 500" |

## Signal Mapping

These pain points surface as detectable signals:
- **Deployment pressure** → Job postings for deployment managers, RFPs for rollout vendors
- **Refresh cycles** → Public announcements of store modernization, remodel programs
- **Labor shortages** → IT layoffs, "return to core operations" signals, lean team indicators
- **Downtime risk** → Negative reviews mentioning outages, POS failures
- **Inconsistency** → Multiple vendor contracts, complaints about standardization
