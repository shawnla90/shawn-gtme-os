# Connext ICP

## Target Accounts

- **Company Type**: Upper Mid-Market to Enterprise, distributed multi-site organizations
- **Revenue**: $500M+
- **Location Footprint**: 100+ physical sites — this is the critical validator and hard gate
- **Geography**: North America (US, Canada, Mexico)
- **Internal Resourcing**: Lean internal IT teams who cannot handle nationwide rollouts themselves

## Why 100+ Locations Matters

The 100+ location threshold is the primary qualification gate because:
- It justifies outsourcing deployment to a national partner
- It requires the scale and consistency that Connext delivers
- Below 100 locations, companies can typically handle rollouts internally
- This is the "hard gate" in Clay enrichment — validate location count before anything else

## Key Verticals

| Vertical | Examples | Why They Fit |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Retail | Target, Dollar General | Big box + specialty + convenience, constant refresh cycles |
| QSR & Restaurants | Chick-fil-A, Starbucks | Standardized tech across chains, POS + network needs |
| Grocery & Pharmacy | Publix, CVS | High-volume environments, IoT + connectivity demands |
| Financial Services | Banks with branch networks | Security + compliance + consistent infrastructure |
| Healthcare | Clinic networks, hospital systems | Satellite locations, critical uptime requirements |

## Qualification Criteria

A qualified Connext target meets:
- [ ] $500M+ revenue
- [ ] 100+ physical locations (HARD GATE — must validate)
- [ ] North America footprint
- [ ] Lean internal IT (can't self-execute nationwide rollouts)
- [ ] In a key vertical (retail, QSR, grocery, financial, healthcare)
- [ ] Shows deployment or refresh need signals

## Disqualifiers

- Single-site complexity (not Connext's model)
- <100 locations (doesn't justify national outsourcing)
- Strong internal deployment teams (no outsourcing need)
- Non-physical / purely digital businesses
