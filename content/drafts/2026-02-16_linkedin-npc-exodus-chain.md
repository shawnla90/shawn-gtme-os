## OPTION A — The Pattern Recognition Play

### POST 1 of 3 — The Observation

every third post on my LinkedIn feed right now is the same post.

some CEO said something at a conference. someone screenshots it. adds a paragraph that says absolutely nothing. throws on a take that sounds like it was generated in 4 seconds.

X is dead. cold email is dead. SDRs are dead. marketing is dead.

nothing is dead. you're just farming engagement off someone else's name.

I've been watching this pattern for months. the same accounts. the same format. screenshot a CEO. write two lines of surface-level agreement. collect likes from other people doing the exact same thing.

it's an NPC loop. and the algorithm rewards it.

I'm not saying LinkedIn is useless. I've built real pipeline here. real relationships. real content that actually helped people.

but the signal-to-noise ratio is getting worse. and I'm tired of competing with recycled screenshots for attention.

more on this tomorrow.

### POST 2 of 3 — The Deeper Cut

yesterday I posted about the NPC loop on LinkedIn. the screenshot-a-CEO, say-nothing, collect-likes cycle.

here's what I didn't say.

it's not just annoying. it's actually making the platform worse for everyone who builds.

when the algorithm promotes CEO quote farming over actual technical breakdowns, it trains the feed to reward performance over substance. every builder who posts a real workflow with real screenshots and real prompts gets buried under someone who screenshotted a keynote and typed interesting.

the result is a platform that looks like a thought leadership factory but reads like a copy-paste chain letter.

I'm not quitting LinkedIn. I still post here. I still engage here. but I'm also building somewhere else now.

the builders I respect are already there. the conversations are faster. the noise is different. and nobody is screenshotting Jensen Huang to get 47 likes.

post 3 drops today. where I'm going and how you can follow along.

### POST 3 of 3 — The X CTA

alright. post 3 of 3.

I've been building on X for the past few weeks. posting plays. sharing build logs. running threads about the actual systems I use every day.

and honestly... the engagement is more real over there. fewer NPCs. more builders. shorter format forces you to actually say something instead of padding a screenshot with filler.

I'm not leaving LinkedIn. but I'm not going to pretend this feed isn't getting harder to learn from.

if you've been following my stuff here and you want the unfiltered version. the raw build logs. the quick takes. the stuff that doesn't need 6 paragraphs to land.

come find me on X. follow. engage. reply to things. the algorithm over there actually rewards conversation, not just impressions.

I'm @ShawnTenam on X.

the more traction I build there, the less I need to fight the NPC algorithm here.

no gatekeeping. same content. faster feed. let's build.

## OPTION B — The Frustrated Builder

### POST 1 of 3 — The Breaking Point

I opened LinkedIn this morning and counted 11 posts in a row that were the same thing.

CEO said a thing. person screenshots it. person writes two sentences agreeing. gets 200 likes.

no workflow. no example. no substance. just... agreement with a famous person.

this is what the feed has become. a karaoke machine for executive quotes.

and the worst part is it works. LinkedIn's algorithm eats this stuff up. the engagement numbers on a recycled CEO screenshot regularly beat a 1200-word technical breakdown with actual prompts and formulas in the comments.

I'm not bitter about it. okay maybe a little. but mostly I'm just bored.

I got into content because I wanted to share what I actually build. the plays. the workflows. the ugly debugging sessions. the messy builds that eventually work.

none of that looks like a conference keynote screenshot with the word fascinating underneath it.

something has to change. and I think it starts with where I put my energy.

### POST 2 of 3 — The Honest Part

follow-up to yesterday's post about the NPC feed.

I got a bunch of DMs that all said roughly the same thing. yeah I feel the same way but I'm scared to say it because the algorithm will bury me.

that's the whole problem right there.

the platform has trained people to optimize for reach instead of resonance. to screenshot instead of build. to agree instead of share something real.

and when even the people who know it's broken are afraid to say so... that's a platform that's eating itself.

I built real things on LinkedIn. a content operating system. a following of builders. actual pipeline from actual posts. I'm not ungrateful.

but I'm also not going to keep pretending that fighting for visibility against CEO-quote-farmers is where my best content should live exclusively.

the play is diversification. same content. multiple platforms. and shifting energy toward the one where the builders are actually talking to each other.

post 3 coming today with the specific ask.

### POST 3 of 3 — The Ask

last one. post 3 of 3.

I've been posting on X more consistently. plays, build logs, system shares, the same stuff you see here but tighter and faster.

and I'll be real. the reason I'm pushing toward X is simple.

over there, when someone replies, it's usually because they have something to say. not because they're trying to game the algorithm with a one-word comment.

here's my ask.

if you read my stuff here. if you've grabbed a prompt from the comments. if you've learned something from a play or a build log or a meme post.

go follow me on X. @ShawnTenam. engage there. reply to threads. add your own takes.

every follow and every reply over there helps me build the kind of audience that actually wants to build. and it gets me one step further from having to compete with the CEO-screenshot-industrial-complex for your attention.

same builder. same no gatekeeping. just a platform where substance actually travels.

## OPTION C — The Meme Energy Chain

### POST 1 of 3 — The NPC Starter Pack

LinkedIn NPC starter pack for 2026.

step 1. find a CEO quote from a podcast or conference
step 2. screenshot it
step 3. write the word fascinating
step 4. add a take that says nothing new
step 5. end with a question you don't actually want answered
step 6. collect your 200 likes from other people running the same playbook

I see this loop at least 10 times a day now. the same posts. the same structure. the same zero-substance engagement farming wearing a thought leadership costume.

cold email is dead. said the person who has never warmed a domain.
SDRs are dead. said the person who has never sat in a SalesLoft queue at 7am.
outbound is dead. said the person whose entire pipeline comes from... LinkedIn posts about things being dead.

nothing is dead. you're just loud.

### POST 2 of 3 — What They Think vs. What They Said

following up on yesterday's NPC starter pack post.

the engagement on that one told me everything. builders are exhausted.

what the NPC posts think they're saying: I have a unique perspective on industry trends and I'm adding to the conversation.

what the NPC posts are actually saying: I saw a famous person's name and I know the algorithm will push this if I attach myself to it.

the gap between those two things is the whole problem with LinkedIn right now.

the platform used to surface people who built things. now it surfaces people who comment on people who built things. and the people commenting on the commenters. it's NPCs all the way down.

I'm still here. I still post here. but I started building a second home.

somewhere the feed rewards substance and conversation over screenshot curation.

details tomorrow.

### POST 3 of 3 — The Escape Route

alright. the escape route.

I've been building on X. @ShawnTenam. same plays. same build logs. same no gatekeeping energy. just faster, tighter, and with a feed that doesn't make me want to throw my laptop.

here's the honest truth. every minute I spend trying to out-algorithm the CEO-quote-farmers on LinkedIn is a minute I'm not spending actually building something useful.

X isn't perfect. no platform is. but the builders are there. the conversations are real. and nobody has posted the word fascinating under a conference screenshot in my feed even once.

so here's the play.

if you've been reading my posts here. if the plays helped. if the prompts helped. if you're tired of the same feed I'm tired of.

follow me on X. reply to things. engage. build with me there.

the more we build over there, the less any of us need to stay stuck in the NPC loop over here.

same shawn. same content. less noise.

let's go.

## Posting Schedule (All 3 Options)

| Post | Timing | Format |
|------|--------|--------|
| Post 1 | Morning (8-9am) | Text only, strong hook |
| Post 2 | Afternoon (12-1pm) | Text only, follow-up energy |
| Post 3 | Evening (5-6pm) | Text only, CTA with X handle |

## Notes
- All three posts go on LinkedIn as the 3-post chain
- Post 3 cross-post a condensed version to X as well (thread or single)
- No screenshots needed. text-only posts for this theme
- The pattern critique is generic (NPC behavior), not calling out specific people. passes safety filters.
