## Draft 1: "The Receipts Are There" [DRAFT]

> **Platform**: LinkedIn
> **Pillar**: Building & Sharing
> **Purpose**: Drive traffic to shawnos.ai
> **Visual**: screenshot of shawnos.ai landing page with boot log visible

---

I keep saying I'm building in public.

now there's a page you can visit.

shawnos.ai went live this weekend. not a portfolio. not a landing page. not a waitlist. the actual system, running on the open web.

here's what's there:

- a blog written from the same markdown pipeline that generates every piece of content I post
- a daily build log with real output scores, tracked since day one
- an RPG progression system that turns daily work into titles and classes
- a skill guide explaining how the whole scoring engine works
- a full tracker prompt you can copy and use yourself

the site runs on the same codebase as two other domains. one repo. three sites. one push deploys all of them.

every blog post, every log entry, every page on that site shipped through the OS. the system built the website that explains the system. recursive.

go poke around. nothing is gated. nothing requires a signup. the receipts are just there.

### Comment Thread Content (Draft 1)

**Comment 1 (pin):**
link: shawnos.ai

start with the blog if you want the story. start with /log if you want the receipts. start with /rpg-preview if you want to see a scoring system that grades daily output like a game progression.

**Comment 2:**
the full tracker prompt is at shawnos.ai/log/build-your-own. 280+ lines. it turns a daily check-in into a scored output log with letter grades and an RPG title system.

right now it's completely open. no gate, no email, no catch. just copy and use it.

**Comment 3:**
stack for the curious: Next.js, Turborepo monorepo, Vercel hosting, markdown files for all content, Cursor as the IDE, Claude as the build partner. three sites (shawnos.ai, thegtmos.ai, thecontentos.ai) deployed from a single repo.

## Draft 2: "One Repo, One Address" [DRAFT]

> **Platform**: LinkedIn
> **Pillar**: Building & Sharing
> **Purpose**: Drive traffic, system narrative
> **Visual**: screenshot of Cursor workspace showing the three-site monorepo structure

---

one repo. three websites. all built in a weekend.

the monorepo that runs my GTM ops, content pipeline, and outreach campaigns now has an address on the open web.

shawnos.ai. thegtmos.ai. thecontentos.ai.

same codebase. same terminal aesthetic. different accent colors. one push deploys all three.

two weeks ago I had never registered a domain. never configured DNS. never touched Next.js.

this weekend I scaffolded a Turborepo monorepo, connected three Vercel projects, built a shared design system, and shipped a blog, a daily build log, and an RPG progression page that scores my actual daily output.

here's what you'll find if you visit shawnos.ai:

- the blog. post zero is live. more coming this week.
- the daily log. every day gets an output score, a letter grade, and an RPG title.
- the progression system. 11 tiers. 5 classes. from Terminal Initiate to Grand Master.
- a 280-line tracker prompt you can copy and run yourself.

nothing is behind a gate. the system is the proof of work.

this is what building in public looks like when you stop planning and start deploying.

### Comment Thread Content (Draft 2)

**Comment 1 (pin):**
shawnos.ai -- go poke around. I'd start with /blog for the story or /log for the daily receipts.

**Comment 2:**
the three-site architecture in 30 seconds:
- shawnos.ai = personal OS, blog, daily log, RPG system
- thegtmos.ai = GTM engineering breakdowns (launching soon)
- thecontentos.ai = content operating system methodology (launching soon)

all three share a design system. all three deploy from one repo. the only difference is the accent color and the content.

## Draft 3: Build Weekend (Substack Post 3 -- Updated) [DRAFT]

> **Platform**: Substack (OS.AI Labs)
> **Series**: OS.AI Labs, Post 3
> **Purpose**: Monday afternoon push, cross-promo
> **Structure**: Personal POV Essay
> **Visual**: screenshot of shawnos.ai live in a browser, or the Cursor workspace during build

### Subject Line Options

1. the system got an address
2. one repo, three sites, one weekend
3. I built three websites from a code editor this weekend
4. shawnos.ai is live. here's how it happened.
5. building in public means you can visit the build

### Preview Text

Post 3 of OS.AI Labs. the OS now lives on the open web. three sites, one repo, everything deployed from a code editor. here's the build weekend story.

---

### Post Body

## the redirect (again)

I told you the Cursor discovery story was coming. it still is. but the system had other plans.

the plan was one website. shawnos.ai. a blog, a landing page, a home for the operating system on the open web.

then the system did what systems do. it expanded.

## one became three

the agent and I scoped the architecture. mapped the content pillars. and something clicked. one site couldn't hold all of it. the personal journey. the GTM engineering breakdowns. the content methodology. those are three audiences. three search intents. three domains.

shawnos.ai. thegtmos.ai. thecontentos.ai.

same repo. same terminal aesthetic. same shared design system. different accent color per site. green, amber, cyan. a Turborepo monorepo where one push deploys all three.

the plan rewrote itself while I was inside it. recursive.

## what shipped

shawnos.ai is live right now. here's what's on it:

**the blog.** post zero is up. not a manifesto. just the first commit on what happens when you treat GTM like an engineering problem. more posts dropping this week.

**the daily build log.** every day gets a scored entry. what I built, what I shipped, how many words of content. the tracker calculates an output score, assigns a letter grade, and updates my RPG title. the receipts are public. all of them.

**the progression system.** 11 tiers from Terminal Initiate to Grand Master. 5 class specializations. the title you see on my avatar badge is the title the daily log earned. it's not a game. it's a scoring engine for consistent output.

**the skill guide.** explains how the scoring works. what earns XP. how titles unlock. how classes are assigned.

**the tracker prompt.** the full 280-line prompt that powers the daily log. copy-paste ready. nothing gated. nothing locked.

## building vs sharing

I've been saying I build in public. and I meant it. I was sharing Clay tables, walking through enrichment flows, posting prompts in the comments. no gatekeeping.

but that was sharing in public. not building.

this is building in public. three domains registered. DNS configured. Vercel connected. Turborepo scaffolded. a shared design system built from scratch. blog engine, log system, RPG page. all live. all deployed from a code editor.

I don't have a polished SaaS to show you. I have a system with an address and a build log that proves it runs every day.

that's the difference.

## the stack

for the builders who want specifics:

- **Turborepo** -- monorepo management across three Next.js apps
- **Next.js** -- framework for all three sites
- **Vercel** -- hosting, auto-deploys on push
- **Cloudflare** -- DNS
- **Cursor** -- the IDE where everything lives
- **Claude** -- the agent that helped architect and build it
- **markdown files** -- all blog posts and log entries are plain markdown
- **git** -- version control for everything, including content

two weeks ago I had never registered a domain. this weekend I deployed three sites from a monorepo. the system doesn't require you to already know everything. it requires you to be willing to learn the next skill.

## what comes next

the Cursor discovery story. the moment a code editor became an operating system. that one's been waiting. it's coming this week.

but right now, the system has a home. and you can visit it.

## Draft 4: Substack Cross-Promo Snippet [DRAFT]

> **Platform**: LinkedIn
> **Pillar**: Building & Sharing
> **Purpose**: Short post teasing the Substack newsletter
> **Visual**: none (text-only post, keep it light)

---

the OS.AI Labs newsletter just dropped a new post.

the full build weekend story. how one website became three. the Turborepo architecture. what's actually live on shawnos.ai right now and why none of it is gated.

if you've been following the build-in-public journey here, this is the deep cut. the stuff that doesn't fit in a LinkedIn post.

subscribe link is in the comments. free, no catch, no pitch deck at the end.

### Comment Thread Content (Draft 4)

**Comment 1 (pin):**
subscribe to OS.AI Labs on Substack: shawntenam.substack.com

three posts live so far. the system, the identity shift, and now the build weekend. the Cursor discovery story drops this week.

## Draft 5: X Launch Thread [DRAFT]

> **Platform**: X
> **Purpose**: 3-5 tweets, compressed launch announcement
> **Visual**: tweet 1 screenshot of shawnos.ai, rest are text-only

---

### Tweet 1 (hook)

shawnos.ai is live.

built three websites from a code editor this weekend. one repo. one push. three deploys.

here's what's on it and why nothing is gated. 🧵

### Tweet 2 (what's there)

what you'll find:

- a blog running on markdown files
- a daily build log with scored output and letter grades
- an RPG progression system (11 tiers, 5 classes)
- a 280-line tracker prompt you can copy right now

all public. all built from the same codebase.

### Tweet 3 (the architecture)

the stack:

shawnos.ai -- personal OS, blog, daily log
thegtmos.ai -- GTM engineering (launching soon)
thecontentos.ai -- content methodology (launching soon)

Turborepo monorepo. Next.js. Vercel. one repo deploys all three.

### Tweet 4 (the arc)

two weeks ago I had never registered a domain.

this weekend I deployed a three-site network from a Cursor terminal.

the system doesn't require you to already know everything. it requires you to learn the next skill. and the next one.

### Tweet 5 (CTA)

go look: shawnos.ai

start with /blog for the story.
start with /log for the receipts.
start with /rpg-preview to see a scoring system that grades daily output like a game.

nothing gated. nothing locked. just the system, live.
