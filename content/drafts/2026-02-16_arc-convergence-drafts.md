## Draft 1: "the about page nobody asked for"

### LinkedIn Version

the about page nobody asked for

every GTM creator has the same one.

"I was an SDR. then I found Clay. now I teach people how to use it."

cool.

mine starts with copper pipe and a blowtorch.

I was a plumber before I was in tech. not a metaphor. actual plumbing. diagnosing problems by listening to walls. tracing systems nobody documented. fixing things under pressure while water sprayed everywhere.

then I became an SDR. 200+ emails a day. primary domains. no warmup. building buying committees by hand in Salesforce.

now I build the systems that automate what I used to do manually. Clay tables, HubSpot workflows, Instantly sequences, web reveal qualification. all from a monorepo. all from Cursor.

the plumber taught me to trace systems. the SDR taught me what actually converts. the engineer turned both into infrastructure.

none of these define me. all of them sharpen what I ship.

rebuilt the about page. it's different now.

"I was an SDR, then I found Clay"

mine starts with copper pipe and a blowtorch

plumber → SDR → GTM engineer

none of them define me. all of them sharpen what I ship

## Draft 2: "this wasn't a one-shot prompt"

### LinkedIn Version

this wasn't a one-shot prompt

the site has 400+ files. three domains. a daily tracker, an RPG progression system, an avatar that evolves based on real output data.

none of it was generated in one shot.

here's what the build actually looked like:

plan mode before writing a single line. every feature started as a plan I reviewed, questioned, and revised before any code was written.

ask mode when things broke. and things broke constantly. Pillow rendering at 0x0 pixels. avatar sprites loading from wrong paths. progression formulas that didn't account for zero-output days.

sub-agents for parallel execution. when I needed to wire routes into three apps simultaneously, I didn't do them one by one.

test, break, read the error, fix it, ship it. repeat.

there's a version of this story where I say "I built a website with AI in one weekend." that version is a lie by omission. the real version is weeks of iteration, debugging, and learning what the tools actually do.

AI doesn't do the work for you. it accelerates the work you already understand.

the site is the proof of work.

### X Version

"I built this with AI"

cool. was it one prompt?

400+ files. 3 domains. daily tracker. RPG system. avatar that evolves from real data.

none of it was one-shot

plan mode → ask mode → test → break → fix → ship → repeat

AI accelerates the work you already understand. it doesn't replace the understanding

## Draft 3: "quest board is live"

### LinkedIn Version

quest board is live

I built a daily tracker, a Pillow dashboard, an RPG progression engine, and an avatar system. all from a monorepo. all with Cursor + Claude.

now you can try.

the quest board at shawnos.ai/log/quests has five challenges:

1. boot sequence — scan your repo and output a JSON log
2. first pixel — render your first Pillow-generated dashboard card
3. the progression layer — add XP, levels, and titles
4. ship it live — deploy to a real URL with API routes
5. come at me — fork the approach and build something better

these aren't tutorials. there's no video walkthrough. there's no hand-holding.

each quest tells you what to build, what tools you'll need, and how to actually use AI to do it. plan mode, ask mode, debugging, iteration. the real workflow, not the demo version.

fair warning: you're going to fail at quest 2. Pillow's coordinate system will confuse you. your first image will render at 0x0. that's part of it.

the people who get the most from AI aren't the ones who prompt the fastest. they're the ones who understand what they're building well enough to direct the tools effectively.

ship something. tag me. best forks get featured.

### X Version (post + reply thread)

**Post:**

quest board is live

5 challenges. no tutorials. no hand-holding.

1. boot sequence (Python + git)
2. first pixel (Pillow dashboard)
3. progression layer (XP + levels)
4. ship it live (Vercel + API)
5. come at me (open challenge)

you're going to fail at quest 2. that's the point.

shawnos.ai/log/quests

**Reply 1:**

the real skill isn't Python or Pillow

it's learning how to build with AI without losing your ability to think

plan mode before code. ask mode when it breaks. read the error before you prompt.

**Reply 2:**

built something? tag me

best forks get featured on the quest page

no gatekeeping. the whole system is documented.

## Draft 4: "three sites, one repo, zero accidents"

### LinkedIn Version

three sites, one repo, zero accidents

I run three domains:

shawnos.ai — the builder. daily tracker, RPG progression, avatar system, API layer. personal infrastructure.

thegtmos.ai — the playbook. GTM engineering frameworks, campaign architectures, workflow breakdowns.

thecontentos.ai — the voice engine. content-as-code, voice DNA, repurpose pipelines.

all three run from a single monorepo. Turborepo. Next.js. shared components. one deploy pipeline.

this wasn't a branding exercise. the split happened because each domain needed its own identity while sharing the same technical foundation.

the GTM playbooks reference the same tools I build on in the personal OS. the content system uses the same voice DNA across all three. the API serves data to all three sites from the same endpoints.

when I ship a new skill, it shows up everywhere. when I update the voice guide, every platform adapts. when the avatar levels up, all three sites reflect it.

that's not three websites. it's one system with three interfaces.

the alternative was a Notion page with three sections. I chose to build the architecture instead.

shawnos.ai | thegtmos.ai | thecontentos.ai

### X Version

3 domains. 1 monorepo. 0 accidents.

shawnos.ai → the builder
thegtmos.ai → the playbook
thecontentos.ai → the voice engine

shared components. one deploy pipeline. when I ship a skill, it shows up everywhere.

this isn't 3 websites. it's 1 system with 3 interfaces.
