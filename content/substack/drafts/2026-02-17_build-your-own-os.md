## Post Body

## the toolkit

this series has been the full arc. Post 1 was the reveal. Post 2 was the identity shift. why the system matters more than any single tool. Post 3 was the discovery. the 17 tabs. the frozen laptop. the moment Cursor stopped being a code editor and became an operating system.

today you get the toolkit.

## the problem nobody talks about

I had 17 tabs open. Instantly in one. HubSpot in another. Clay. Slack. Google Sheets. LinkedIn. A Notion doc I hadn't updated in three weeks. my laptop was frozen. not "slow." frozen. and I was supposed to be the guy building efficient GTM systems.

the real problem wasn't the tools. every tool was fine on its own. the problem was the switching. every time I jumped between contexts, I lost 5 minutes re-orienting. every time I needed data from one tool inside another, I copy-pasted. every time I wanted to remember how I set something up last month, I searched through old Slack messages.

this is the reality most GTM and content people live in. and nobody frames it as a solvable architecture problem. they frame it as "you need better productivity habits." no. you need a better system.

## what changed

I learned Cursor. then I learned Claude Code. and then I discovered MCPs.

Model Context Protocol means your AI tools talk to your other tools natively. your code editor talks to your CRM. your content system talks to your outreach stack. suddenly the repo isn't just where code lives. it's the operating system that connects everything.

in Post 1 I showed you what I built. in Post 2 I talked about why the system matters more than any tool. in Post 3 I told you how I found the environment. this post gives you the starting point to build your own.

## what I'm giving you

I put together a scaffold package. it's not my repo. it's the prompt and the templates to build yours.

here's what's in it:

**the scaffold prompt.** one prompt you paste into Claude Code or Cursor. it asks you 3 questions -- your name, your platforms, your tool stack -- then it builds the entire directory structure. the 3-tier skill architecture. the content pipeline folders. the .gitignore. the README. everything scaffolded and ready to fill in.

**platform playbook starters.** lite templates for X, Reddit, TikTok, and YouTube. they give you the structure, the content formats, the cross-posting rules, and the platform-specific guidelines. you fill in your voice, your tone, your patterns.

**an AI slop detection checklist.** 6 of the most common patterns that make AI-assisted content sound like a language model instead of you. em-dashes, authority signaling, dramatic framing, bookend summaries, humble brag disclaimers. run it on every draft.

**an MCP connection guide.** which MCPs to connect based on your stack type. if you're GTM and outbound: Instantly, HeyReach, Firecrawl. if you're content and creator: Typefully, Substack, Reddit. if you're both: GitHub, Browserbase, Slack. each one with what it does and why you'd connect it.

**a security layer guide.** how to set up your .gitignore properly. what to protect vs. what to share. environment variables, folder-level security, pre-push checklists. this part matters more than people think.

## the video

I recorded myself running the scaffold prompt from scratch. empty folder. one prompt. 3 questions. watch the whole thing get built in real time.

you'll see exactly what gets generated, how the output is structured, and what the file tree looks like when it's done. if you're the kind of person who wants to see it before you try it, this is your walkthrough.

## what this is not

I want to be honest about something. this scaffold gives you the architecture. it does not give you the skill.

if you think you're going to paste one prompt, run it, and become a Cursor power user overnight... it doesn't work that way. I'm still learning this every day. I've burned entire afternoons debugging things that should have taken 20 minutes. I've accidentally staged client data for a commit. I've written skills that broke three other skills.

the scaffold gives you somewhere to put things. the mastery comes from using it. from writing your first voice file and realizing it's wrong. from building your first skill and watching it fail. from pushing your first commit and then immediately seeing something you need to change.

this is a long game. the prompt gives you a foundation. you build the rest by doing the work.

## where to get the full package

the scaffold prompt, the MCP guide, the security guide, and all 5 platform templates are available to OS.AI Labs subscribers. if you're reading this, you already have access.

everything is in markdown. copy what you need. paste the prompt into Claude Code or Cursor. answer the 3 questions. start building.

and then reply to this email and tell me what you built. I genuinely want to know.

## what's next

Post 5 will be a deep dive into one of the Cursor skills that runs my daily content pipeline. the one that turns a screenshot into 3 LinkedIn drafts and a 10-post X thread in under a minute. I'll break down the full skill file and show you how to build your own.

the lab is open. let's build.

## CTA Block

if this was useful, forward it to someone who's drowning in tabs and ready for a better system. or reply and tell me what tool you're connecting first. I read every single reply.

the scaffold prompt, MCP guide, security guide, video walkthrough, and all platform templates are included below for subscribers. no gatekeeping.

## Visual Notes

- **Primary image**: Screenshot of the scaffold prompt running in Cursor or Claude Code, showing the directory tree being generated
- **Secondary image**: The completed directory structure in a file tree view (after the prompt runs)
- **Video embed**: YouTube video walkthrough of the live scaffold build (recorded Friday)
- Consider a fourth: the MCP guide section showing the tool categories

## Lead Magnet Assets (Embed or Link Below Post)

Reference the package files from `content/substack/lead-magnet/`:
- `scaffold-prompt.md` -- the full Claude Code prompt
- `mcp-guide.md` -- MCP recommendations by stack type
- `security-guide.md` -- .gitignore, env vars, protection guide
- `youtube-outline.md` -- (reference only, the actual video link goes in the post body)
- `templates/x-playbook-starter.md`
- `templates/reddit-playbook-starter.md`
- `templates/tiktok-playbook-starter.md`
- `templates/youtube-playbook-starter.md`
- `templates/ai-slop-basics.md`

These get embedded in the Substack post below the main article, or linked as downloadable resources.

## Cross-Platform Notes

- LinkedIn promo: compress the "17 tabs frozen laptop" hook into a post that drives to Substack for the full scaffold
- X promo: thread format hitting the problem, the solution, what the prompt builds, the honest disclaimer, link to Substack
- Reddit promo: value-first post in r/ClaudeAI, r/CursorAI -- share the directory structure and the thinking behind it, profile link does the Substack funnel work
- This post has high repurpose potential. the scaffold prompt itself can be a standalone LinkedIn post. the AI slop checklist can be a standalone X thread. the MCP guide can be a standalone Reddit post.
- The YouTube video can be promoted independently on YouTube with a link to the newsletter in the description.

## Notes

- **Why Tactical Breakdown**: Post 1 was the reveal. Post 2 was the identity shift. Post 3 was the discovery journey. Post 4 delivers the toolkit. This is the natural culmination of the series arc.
- **Word count**: ~900 words in the body
- **Tone check**: builder sharing from experience, not preaching. honest about the learning curve. generous with the resources. the lead magnet is a gift, not a product.
- **Lead magnet strategy**: everything lives inside the Substack post for subscribers. no external downloads, no separate landing page. subscribe to OS.AI Labs, get the full package in Post 3.
- **Video integration**: the YouTube link sits naturally in the flow between "what I'm giving you" and "what this is not." it's additional value, not the main event. people who prefer reading get the post. people who prefer watching get the video. both get the scaffold prompt.
- **Series callback**: the opening references all three prior posts (reveal, identity, discovery). this creates continuity for readers who followed the whole arc, and gives new subscribers a roadmap to catch up.
