Post 3 of OS.AI Labs. the content OS is getting its own website. here's the plan, the stack, and why I'm building it before I ask anyone to visit.

## Post Body

## the plan

I was going to tell you the Cursor story today. the moment a code editor became an operating system. that's still coming. monday.

but the system needs a home on the web first.

## why now

the content OS lives in a repo. LinkedIn, X, Substack, Reddit. four platforms, four playbooks, four pipelines. it works. it's modular. it's growing.

but none of those platforms are mine.

LinkedIn could change their algorithm tomorrow. Substack could sunset a feature. every piece of content I create lives on rented land. and I've been building a system designed to outlast any single tool.

the system itself doesn't have its own address. this weekend that changes.

## the weekend sprint

I'm learning web hosting from scratch. and I do mean scratch.

two weeks ago I didn't know what a git repo was. now I'm about to register a domain, set up DNS through Cloudflare, scaffold a Next.js project on Vercel, and build a site that matches the terminal aesthetic you've seen across these posts. dark background. green accents. monospace type. the AI/os brand as an actual website.

the stack:

- **osailabs.ai** as the domain
- **Vercel** for hosting (auto-deploys when I push to GitHub)
- **Next.js** for the framework
- **Cloudflare** for DNS and CDN
- **markdown files** for the blog (same pattern as everything else in the repo)

no Squarespace. no drag-and-drop. the whole site lives inside the repo. when I push a blog post, it deploys automatically. zero extra steps.

## what this unlocks

the website becomes the canonical home. blog posts live there first. Substack becomes a syndication channel. which means:

- SEO works (my domain, my ranking)
- I control the design and the experience
- content lives in one place and distributes everywhere
- the repo becomes the operating system for the entire web presence. not just content. everything.

this isn't a redesign project. this is the next layer of the system.

## the learning edge

I have no idea how Vercel works. I've never registered a domain. I've never configured DNS. I've never touched Next.js.

two weeks ago I was an SDR who learned GTM from grinding Salesforce. now I'm about to build and deploy a website from a code editor.

the system doesn't require you to already know everything. it requires you to be willing to learn the next skill. and the next one.

this weekend. osailabs.ai. from nothing to deployed.

monday I'll tell you the Cursor story. today I just wanted to share the plan while it's still a plan. because by monday it'll be a build log.

## CTA Block

if you're building something from scratch too, reply and tell me what it is. I read every single reply. and if you're not subscribed yet, monday's post is the one that started everything. the Cursor discovery story.

---

## Visual Notes

- **Primary image**: the terminal design system color palette from the website launch plan (the CSS variables showing the exact hex codes: near-black canvas, green accent, panel fill, etc.)
- **Alternative**: a Cursor screenshot showing the website launch plan open in the editor with the todo items visible
- **Third option**: a simple mockup or sketch of what osailabs.ai could look like with the terminal aesthetic
- Keep visuals builder-authentic. this is a plan post, so the plan itself IS the visual.

---

## Cross-Platform Notes

- This is a lightweight friday drop. not the heavy promo treatment.
- Optional LinkedIn post: short version of the plan, "dropping the full story on Substack" CTA.
- X: quick post about the weekend sprint, link to Substack.
- The heavy cross-platform promo stays on monday for the Cursor Discovery post.
- This post naturally bridges Post 2 (identity shift away from tools) to Post 4 (the Cursor discovery). the website build is the next expression of that identity.

---

## Notes

- **Why this post exists**: the website needs to be live (or at minimum, domain registered and hosting connected) before the Cursor Discovery post drives people to explore the system. the plan goes: share the plan (friday) → build over the weekend → tell the Cursor story with the website already in motion (monday).
- **Continuity note**: Post 2 (published) teases "friday I'm sharing the specific discovery that changed everything." This post acknowledges the pivot directly in the opening: "I was going to tell you the Cursor story today... that's still coming. monday." Honest redirect. no pretending the plan didn't change.
- **Word count**: ~450 words in the body
- **Tone check**: forward-looking builder energy. this isn't reflective like Posts 1 and 2. this is excited about what's next. the "I have no idea how Vercel works" admission keeps it real. the stack list makes it concrete. the weekend deadline makes it urgent.
- **The Squarespace line**: deliberately calling out that a builder builds, doesn't drag-and-drop. not a dig at anyone using Squarespace. it's a positioning statement about the brand.
- **Narrative arc**: Post 1 (the system) → Post 2 (the identity shift) → Post 3 (expanding the system to the web) → Post 4 monday (the Cursor discovery that started it all) → Post 5 (the scaffold so you can build yours). the web build post adds a real-time layer to the arc.
