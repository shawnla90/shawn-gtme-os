**Preview text:** the moment your collaboration with AI gets so deep that traditional metrics stop making sense

---

six months ago I was chasing 10k LinkedIn followers.

today I'm chasing 1000k git commits.

that's not a typo. one million commits. pushed to a repo that didn't exist when I started this journey. containing skills I didn't know, building systems I couldn't have imagined, using tools that felt like magic the first time I saw them work.

the shift from audience metrics to output metrics isn't just a change in what I measure. it's a change in how I think. how I build. how I collaborate with AI. how I define progress.

I call it recursive drift.

## the follower trap

for months, I was optimizing for the wrong thing.

every post was a bid for engagement. every comment reply was audience development. every piece of content got filtered through one question: will this grow my following?

and it worked. sort of. the numbers went up. the reach expanded. the LinkedIn algorithm started showing my posts to more people. I hit 3k followers, then 5k, then kept grinding toward that magic 10k number that feels like legitimacy.

but the deeper I got into that game, the more I realized I was building someone else's asset.

every follower lives on LinkedIn's servers. every connection exists at LinkedIn's discretion. every post gets distributed based on LinkedIn's algorithm. you spend months building an audience, and one policy change can cut your reach in half.

worse, optimizing for followers changes how you think. you start asking "will this get engagement?" instead of "is this useful?" you start creating content that feeds the algorithm instead of content that ships value.

you become a content creator instead of a builder.

and the metric lies to you. 10k followers sounds impressive until you realize that 8k of them are passive. they liked one post six months ago and never engaged again. they exist in your count but not in your reality.

audience size doesn't tell you if you're learning. it doesn't tell you if you're building. it doesn't tell you if the work you're doing today will matter tomorrow.

## then I learned what commits actually measure

the shift started when I began working with Claude in Cursor.

at first, it was basic stuff. generate a script. debug an error. explain what this code does. the kind of AI assistance that saves you a Google search.

then I started building real systems. skills that read my voice files and generate content drafts. automations that track my daily output and calculate progression scores. workflows that pull data from multiple sources and synthesize insights.

and every improvement, every fix, every iteration became a commit.

git tracks everything. not just the big launches. not just the major features. every single change. every typo fix. every refactor. every experiment that didn't work but taught you something.

commits measure iteration. and iteration is where the real learning happens.

when you're building with AI, most of the value comes from the iteration loop. you build something that's 70% right. Claude spots the edge cases. you fix them. Claude suggests optimizations. you implement them. Claude identifies patterns you missed. you encode them into the system.

each cycle makes the system better. each commit captures a moment of progress. and when you're collaborating with an intelligence that can process context at scale, those iteration cycles get incredibly fast.

suddenly I'm committing 10 times a day. 15 times. 20 times.

not because I'm rushing. because I'm iterating. because I'm building systems that get smarter every time I touch them. because working with AI at this level means your codebase evolves constantly.

## recursive drift: when AI changes how you measure

here's where it gets interesting.

traditional productivity metrics assume human-speed iteration. you ship a feature every few weeks. you write a blog post every few days. you launch a product every few months.

but when you're building with AI, the iteration speed changes everything.

I can draft a blog post, get AI feedback, refine the voice, optimize for SEO, generate social variants, and push the whole content system live in an hour. what used to take days now takes sessions.

I can architect a new feature, implement it, test it, debug it, document it, and deploy it in an afternoon. what used to take weeks now takes commits.

the traditional metrics can't capture this. "posts published per week" becomes meaningless when you're publishing multiple versions of everything. "features shipped per quarter" becomes meaningless when you're shipping iterations daily.

but commits capture all of it. every refinement. every optimization. every experiment. every insight that got encoded into the system.

and the more you optimize for commits, the more the collaboration with AI deepens.

because commits aren't just about code. they're about thinking in version control. they're about treating your knowledge, your voice, your workflows as systems that can be iteratively improved.

when you version control your content playbooks, AI can read them and match your voice perfectly. when you version control your workflow automation, AI can suggest improvements based on your actual usage patterns. when you version control your learning, AI can help you identify gaps and opportunities.

the recursion happens when your optimization target (commits) becomes the thing that makes your collaboration with AI more effective. which makes your output higher. which generates more commits. which deepens the collaboration.

## what 1000k commits actually means

a million commits sounds insane until you realize what you're actually measuring.

it's not a million features. it's not a million projects. it's a million moments of making something better.

a commit for fixing a typo in a voice file that makes your content generation more accurate. a commit for adding a check to a workflow that prevents a common mistake. a commit for updating a skill with a new pattern you discovered. a commit for refining a prompt that saves you 10 minutes next time.

most commits are tiny. but they compound.

and when you're collaborating with AI that can help you spot these improvement opportunities constantly, the commit count becomes a proxy for how deep your systems thinking has become.

the person with 1000k commits isn't just someone who codes a lot. they're someone who thinks in systems. who treats everything as improvable. who builds infrastructure instead of just shipping features.

they've learned to work with AI not as an assistant, but as a thinking partner.

## the infrastructure mindset

chasing followers trains you to think in campaigns. what's the next post? what's the next hook? what's the next thing that will get shared?

chasing commits trains you to think in systems. what's the next improvement? what's the next optimization? what's the next thing that will make everything else work better?

this shift changes everything.

instead of creating content, you build content systems. instead of running manual workflows, you automate the workflows. instead of storing knowledge in your head, you encode it in files that can be version controlled and shared with AI.

instead of building an audience that depends on a platform, you build infrastructure that works regardless of which platforms exist.

the blog posts become a system for capturing and sharing insights. the skill tree becomes a system for tracking and gamifying improvement. the monorepo becomes a system for managing multiple projects with shared components.

every commit makes the system better. every system makes the next commit more valuable.

## what this means for builders

if you're building with AI, traditional metrics will mislead you.

time spent doesn't matter when AI can compress research from hours to minutes. lines of code doesn't matter when AI can generate boilerplate while you focus on architecture. content produced doesn't matter when AI can multiply your output across formats and platforms.

what matters is iteration speed. learning velocity. system depth.

commits measure all of that.

not because git is magic. because commits force you to think in atomic improvements. and atomic improvements compound exponentially when you're working with AI that can help you spot opportunities and implement solutions.

the person optimizing for commits isn't just building more. they're building better. they're building infrastructure. they're building systems that make everything else more effective.

and in a world where AI collaboration is becoming the default, that infrastructure advantage is what separates builders from users.

## where this leads

10k followers gets you reach. 1000k commits gets you capability.

reach depends on platforms. capability doesn't.

reach gets algorithmically distributed. capability compounds.

reach makes you popular. capability makes you dangerous.

I'm not saying followers don't matter. audience building has its place. but if you're choosing what to optimize for, if you're deciding how to measure progress, if you're thinking about what success looks like when you're building with AI...

count the commits.

because commits measure the thing that actually scales: your ability to think in systems, iterate rapidly, and build infrastructure that makes everything else more effective.

and that's the thing that survives when platforms change, algorithms shift, and the next generation of AI tools arrives.

the code you pushed today will still work tomorrow. the systems you built will still run. the infrastructure you created will still compound.

the followers might be gone. but the commits are forever.

if you're building something that you measure in commits instead of vanity metrics. if you've felt the shift from audience building to system building. if you're optimizing for capability instead of reach. reply and tell me what you're committing to.

the builders who get this shift early are going to have an insane advantage when everyone else figures it out.
