## Subject Line Options

1. I planned one website. I'm building three.
2. build weekend. three sites, one repo, zero excuses.
3. this is what building in public actually looks like
4. I bought three domains and started scaffolding by friday night
5. one site became three. the system did that.

## Preview Text

Post 3 of OS.AI Labs. the content OS planned one website. the recursive energy turned it into a three-site network. here's what build weekend looks like from the inside.

## Post Body

## the redirect

I told you friday would be the discovery story. the moment a code editor became an operating system. that's still coming. monday.

but today I have something better than a story.

today I'm in the middle of a build. and the build already outgrew the plan.

## one became three

the original plan was one website. shawnos.ai. a blog, a landing page, a home for the content OS on the open web.

then I started planning with the system. the agent and I scoped the architecture, mapped the content pillars, and something clicked. one site couldn't hold all of it. the personal journey, the GTM system breakdowns, the content methodology. those are three audiences. three search intents. three domains.

shawnos.ai. thegtmos.ai. thecontentos.ai.

same repo. same terminal aesthetic. same shared design system. different accent color per site. green, amber, cyan. a Turborepo monorepo where one push deploys all three.

the plan rewrote itself while I was inside it.

recursive.

## this is building in public

I've been saying I build in public for months. and I believed it. I was sharing Clay tables, walking through enrichment flows, posting prompts in the comments. no gatekeeping.

but that was sharing in public. not building.

this is building in public. I purchased three domains. configured DNS records. connected each one to Vercel. pointed them at a GitHub repo with build branches. I'm scaffolding a monorepo as I type this. learning Next.js, Turborepo, and Vercel deploy pipelines in real time.

I don't have a finished product to show you. I have a file tree, a plan, and a friday night terminal window.

that's the difference.

## the name

I saw shawnos.ai and I knew immediately. Shawn OS. personal operating system, powered by AI.

then I pulled it apart. S.H.A.W.N. Self-Hosted AI Workspace Node.

that wasn't planned. the backronym describes exactly what the system is. a self-hosted workspace that runs AI natively. the repo. Cursor. the whole architecture.

sometimes the system names itself.

## not vibe coding

there's a version of this where I paste a prompt into an AI and say build me three websites. one shot. ship it.

that's not what's happening here.

I'm planning each task. scoping each agent by what it's responsible for. reviewing every file it generates. debugging the config when Vercel throws an error. understanding why the DNS propagation takes time. learning the difference between an A record and a CNAME.

this is how you actually learn. not by asking AI to do it for you. by being with the system every single step. AI is the accelerator. I'm the architect.

vibe coding can be a real door into building. or it can be a passive buzzword. I'm choosing the door.

## what's next

this isn't build day anymore. it's build weekend. by monday, three domains will be live. shawnos.ai with a full blog and terminal aesthetic. thegtmos.ai and thecontentos.ai as coming-soon placeholders with their own accent colors and a link back to the mothership.

monday I'll tell you the real origin story. how I went from 17 frozen browser tabs to a modular operating system inside Cursor. the discovery that started all of this.

but right now I'm going back to the terminal. there's a shared design system to build and three sites waiting for their first deploy.

you should be here for this.

## CTA Block

if you're building something from scratch too. something where the plan keeps growing while you're inside it. reply and tell me what it is. I read every single reply. and if you're not subscribed yet, monday's post is the one that explains everything. the Cursor discovery story. the moment a code editor became an operating system.

## Visual Notes

- **Primary image**: screenshot of Cursor workspace showing the Turborepo monorepo file tree with apps/shawnos, apps/gtmos, apps/contentos visible. terminal panel open with Vercel or build output.
- **Alternative**: the three-domain plan open in Cursor with the todo list showing infrastructure tasks
- **Bonus**: browser tab showing one of the domains resolving (even if to a placeholder)
- Keep visuals builder-authentic. this is a build weekend post. the build IS the visual.

## Cross-Platform Notes

- LinkedIn companion draft: compressed hook about the 1-to-3 evolution + "building in public vs sharing in public" angle + Substack CTA
- X: quick thread about the friday night build session, domains purchased, what's shipping by monday
- This is the friday drop. lighter promo treatment.
- Heavy cross-platform promo stays on monday for the Cursor Discovery post (Post 4).
- This post bridges Post 2 (identity shift away from tools) to Post 4 (the Cursor discovery). the live build proves the system works before explaining how it was discovered.
- The "building in public vs sharing in public" distinction is a standalone content seed. could become its own LinkedIn post or X thread.

## Notes

- **Why this restructure**: the original Post 3 was about building one website and expanding to 5 platforms. the plan evolved into a 3-site network (shawnos.ai, thegtmos.ai, thecontentos.ai) as a Turborepo monorepo. the recursive expansion. one plan becoming three. IS the story. leaning into that energy.
- **The "building in public" thesis**: this is the post's core insight. for months the claim was "building in public" but the reality was sharing Clay workflows. this. three domains, DNS, Vercel, GitHub, scaffolding a monorepo. this is the real thing. the distinction between sharing in public and building in public is a genuine realization worth naming.
- **The "not vibe coding" angle**: important distinction. this isn't one-shotting a website with AI. it's planning each task, scoping each agent, reviewing every file, debugging config errors, learning the stack. AI as accelerator, not replacement. this positions the build as credible and educational.
- **S.H.A.W.N. backronym**: kept from original draft. Self-Hosted AI Workspace Node. too good to cut. the "sometimes the system names itself" punchline stays.
- **Recursive energy**: the plan rewrote itself. one site became three. the system that was supposed to get a website ended up architecting a network. that's the recursive loop in action. and the post about the system extending itself was written using the system. meta on meta.
- **Word count**: ~620 words in the body
- **Tone check**: excited builder energy. friday night terminal energy. the confession about what "building in public" actually means adds vulnerability without apology. the "not vibe coding" section adds conviction. the closer ("you should be here for this") is an invitation, not a CTA.
- **Narrative arc**: Post 1 (the system) → Post 2 (the identity shift) → Post 3 (the system at full speed, 1 becoming 3, real building in public) → Post 4 monday (the Cursor discovery that started it all) → Post 5 (the scaffold so you can build yours).
- **Domain hidden layers (for future posts/easter eggs)**: Shaw+NOS+AI (Network Operating System), Shawno+SAI (Japanese: talent), "Shawn knows" spoken fast, Ai (Japanese: love). These don't go in this post but inform future site features and content.
