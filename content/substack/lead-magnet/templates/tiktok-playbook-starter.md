## Platform DNA

TikTok (and Reels/Shorts) is the show-don't-tell layer. Where text posts describe what you built, short-form video proves it. The platform rewards authenticity, fast pacing, and hooks that stop the scroll in under 2 seconds. You don't need production quality. You need something real to show.

In your system, TikTok serves as: a top-of-funnel discovery channel, a way to demonstrate workflows visually, and content that can be repurposed across Reels and Shorts.

## Tone

- Conversational, like you're showing a friend something cool
- Fast-paced, no dead air
- Confident but not performative
- "Watch this" energy, not "let me teach you" energy

## The 16-Second Structure

Most high-performing short-form content follows this arc:

1. **Hook** (0-2 sec): Stop the scroll. One sentence that creates curiosity or tension.
2. **Demo** (3-10 sec): Show the thing. Screen recording, walkthrough, the actual result.
3. **Result** (11-14 sec): What happened. The payoff.
4. **Loop Closer** (15-16 sec): End on something that makes them watch again or comment.

You can go longer (30s, 60s) but the structure scales. Hook stays under 3 seconds regardless.

## Content Formats

### Screen Recording Walkthrough
Show your actual workflow. Record your screen doing the thing. Narrate over it.
- Best for: tool demos, skill triggers, workflow showcases
- Keep mouse movements intentional (no wandering)
- Zoom in on the important parts

### Before/After
Show the manual way, then show your automated way.
- Best for: "I used to do X, now I do Y" transformations
- Split screen or sequential works

### Hot Take to Camera
Direct to camera, one strong opinion, quick evidence.
- Best for: contrarian takes, reactions to industry trends
- Under 30 seconds
- No preamble, start with the take

### Build in Public Clip
Show something you're actively building. Raw, unpolished, real.
- Best for: proving you actually build (not just talk)
- "Here's what I'm working on right now" energy

## Hook Patterns

The hook is everything. If they scroll past in 2 seconds, nothing else matters.

- **Pattern interrupt**: "Stop using [common tool] for [common task]."
- **Curiosity gap**: "This one change cut my workflow from 2 hours to 10 minutes."
- **Proof first**: Start with the result, then explain how.
- **Direct challenge**: "If you're still doing [thing], you're wasting time."
- **Show the screen**: Sometimes the visual IS the hook. Show something impressive immediately.

## Caption Style

- Short and punchy (1-2 sentences)
- Repeat the hook or add context the video doesn't cover
- No essay-length captions
- 3-5 hashtags max (mix niche and broad)
- Example: "built this in 10 minutes with Claude Code. the prompt is in the comments."

## Series Concepts

Create recurring series so people know what to expect:
- **"[X] in [Y] seconds"**: Quick tool demos
- **"What I'd do differently"**: Lessons from real experience
- **"Daily build log"**: What you shipped today
- **"This replaced [old tool]"**: Tool migration stories

Fill in your own series names as they develop.

## Cross-Posting Strategy

| Source | TikTok Treatment |
|--------|-----------------|
| LinkedIn post | Extract the hook, record a 15-30s screen demo of the thing described |
| Substack article | Pull one tactical point, demo it on screen |
| X thread | The thread hook becomes the TikTok hook, compress to video |
| Screen recordings you already have | Trim to 15-60s, add narration, post |

## What to Avoid

- Long intros ("Hey everyone, today I'm going to...")
- No visual element (talking head with no proof)
- Over-produced (TikTok rewards raw and real)
- Reading from a script (unless it's invisible)
- Engagement bait without substance ("comment [word] for the link")
- Posting without a hook (the first frame matters most)

## Equipment Notes

You don't need gear to start:
- Phone screen recording + voiceover = most content
- Desktop screen recording (OBS, Loom, native) for workflow demos
- Edit with CapCut, VEED, or the native TikTok editor
- Add captions (most viewers watch without sound)
