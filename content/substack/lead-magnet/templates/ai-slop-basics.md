# AI Slop Detection Basics

> A starter checklist for catching the most common AI writing patterns in your content. Run this on every draft before publishing.

## What Is AI Slop?

AI slop is the set of writing patterns that language models default to when generating content. These patterns make your writing sound like ChatGPT instead of you. The problem isn't that AI helped you write. The problem is when the AI's voice replaces yours.

Your audience can tell. Maybe not consciously, but they feel it. The content reads "correct" but has no personality. It's smooth but says nothing specific. It follows a structure but has no heartbeat.

## The 6 Patterns to Catch

These are the most common and most damaging AI tells. Check every draft for these before publishing.

### 1. Em-Dashes Everywhere
AI loves em-dashes (--) as a way to insert clauses. Real people rarely write with this many em-dashes. If your draft has more than one, restructure the sentence using periods, commas, or shorter sentences.

**AI pattern**: "The system -- which I built last week -- handles everything from enrichment -- including email verification -- to final output."

**Fix**: "The system handles everything from enrichment to final output. I built it last week. Email verification is included."

### 2. Authority Signaling Phrases
These are phrases AI uses to sound important. They add zero information and make you sound like a thought leader bot.

Watch for:
- "The uncomfortable truth is..."
- "Let me be clear..."
- "Here's what nobody tells you..."
- "The hard truth is..."
- "What most people miss..."

**Fix**: Delete the phrase. Start with the actual point. If the point is strong, it doesn't need a drumroll.

### 3. Dramatic Rhetorical Framing
AI loves to build artificial drama around simple statements.

Watch for:
- "But here's the part where..."
- "And that's when it clicked."
- "Want to know the crazy part?"
- "Here's where it gets interesting..."

**Fix**: State what happened. Let the reader decide if it's interesting. Show, don't announce.

### 4. Three Parallel Dramatic Sentences
AI defaults to groups of three rhythmically identical sentences for emphasis.

**AI pattern**: "You can't see it. You can't copy-paste it away. You have to know it exists."

**Fix**: One direct statement lands harder than three dramatic ones. Pick the strongest and cut the other two.

### 5. The Bookend Summary
AI wraps content in neat bows. It opens with a thesis, then closes with the exact same thesis rephrased 800 words later. Real thinking goes somewhere new by the end.

**AI pattern**: Opens with "Data is the most underutilized asset in GTM." Closes with "At the end of the day, data remains the most powerful and underutilized asset in any go-to-market motion."

**Fix**: Let your ending reflect what you learned from writing the piece, not a restatement of where you started.

### 6. The Humble Brag Disclaimer
AI hedges with false modesty before making a point.

**AI pattern**: "I don't have all the answers, but..." / "I'm no expert, but..." / "This might be controversial, but..."

**Fix**: Share your take directly. The disclaimer makes you sound less credible, not more humble. If you believe something, say it.

## Quick Scan Process

After drafting content (whether AI-assisted or not), run this check:

1. **Ctrl+F for em-dashes** (-- or the actual em-dash character). Replace with periods or restructure.
2. **Read your first sentence out loud.** Does it sound like a LinkedIn bot or like you? If you wouldn't say it in conversation, rewrite it.
3. **Check your opening and closing.** Are they saying the same thing? If yes, rewrite the ending.
4. **Count the dramatic phrases.** If you see more than one from the lists above, your draft has slop. Cut them.
5. **The "friend test."** Would you send this to a friend? If it feels too polished or too formal, it's lost your voice.

## Your Natural Patterns

Not everything that looks AI-generated is slop. You'll develop your own patterns that might look like AI tells but are actually your voice. Document them here so you don't accidentally edit them out:

- Pattern 1:
- Pattern 2:
- Pattern 3:

Example: If you naturally use ellipses (...) for trailing thoughts, that's your voice. Don't flag it as slop just because AI also uses them.

## Going Deeper

This is a starter checklist. As you write more, you'll notice additional patterns specific to your writing and your AI tools. Add them to this file. The goal isn't to avoid AI assistance. It's to make sure the output sounds like you, not like a language model performing you.
