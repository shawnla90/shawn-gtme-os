# X / Twitter Playbook Starter

## Platform DNA

X is the compression layer. Where LinkedIn gives you 1300 characters of breathing room, X forces you to distill. Threads let you go deeper, but each tweet needs to stand alone. The platform rewards sharp thinking, strong takes, and real specifics over polished corporate speak.

In your system, X serves as: a testing ground for hooks, a distribution channel for condensed versions of longer content, and a thread format for step-by-step breakdowns.

## Tone

- Shorter sentences than any other platform
- More direct, less narrative
- Strong first line (the hook carries everything)
- Casual but precise
- Zero filler words

## Content Formats

### Single Tweet
Best for: hot takes, observations, one-liner insights.
- 280 characters max
- One clear thought
- No hashtags needed (they look desperate on X)

### Thread (3-7 tweets)
Best for: breakdowns, tutorials, story arcs.
- Tweet 1 is the hook (must stand alone)
- Each tweet is a complete thought
- Last tweet is the takeaway or CTA
- Number your tweets if over 4 in the thread

### Quote Tweet with Context
Best for: reacting to industry news, adding your take to someone else's insight.
- Your commentary should add value, not just agree
- 1-2 sentences max

### Screenshot + Caption
Best for: showing work, results, tool setups.
- The screenshot does the heavy lifting
- Caption adds the context the image can't show

## Formatting Rules

- 280 characters per tweet (threads bypass this per-tweet)
- No markdown (plain text only)
- Line breaks create visual rhythm. Use them.
- Emojis sparingly (1-2 per tweet max, only if they add meaning)
- No hashtags in main content. If you must, put 1-2 at the very end.
- Links get suppressed in reach. Put them in replies or use "link in bio."

## Cross-Posting from Other Platforms

| Source | X Treatment |
|--------|-------------|
| LinkedIn post | Compress to 1 tweet or 3-tweet thread. Cut the narrative, keep the insight. |
| Substack article | 5-tweet thread: hook, 3 key points, link to full version. |
| Reddit post | Pull the best insight, compress to a single tweet. |
| TikTok script | The hook becomes the tweet. Link to video in reply. |

## What to Avoid

- Thread bro energy (numbering tweets 1/47 when you have 3 points)
- Engagement bait ("like if you agree", "retweet for reach")
- Hashtag stuffing
- Posting links in the main tweet (reply with links instead)
- Generic business advice without specifics
- AI-generated threads (readers can spot them instantly)
