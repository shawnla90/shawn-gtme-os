## Platform DNA

Reddit is the credibility and discovery layer. Posts rank in Google for long-tail queries. Communities are self-policing, meaning corporate speak gets downvoted and genuine sharing gets upvoted. Your best Reddit content reads like you're explaining something to a smart friend.

In your system, Reddit serves as: an SEO and long-tail discovery channel, a place to test ideas and get honest feedback, and a reverse-funnel to your newsletter or main platform.

## Tone

- More conversational than LinkedIn or X
- Self-deprecating humor lands well
- Write like a person, not a brand
- Honesty and specifics outperform polish
- Never reference follower counts or "expert" status

## Content Formats

### Personal Experience Post
"I used [tool] to build [thing]. Here's how."
- Real experience, specific details
- What worked and what didn't
- Honest about limitations

### Mini-Tutorial / Explainer
"Here's a trick I use daily in [tool] that saves me [time]."
- Step-by-step
- Specific enough to follow
- Screenshots help

### Case Study / Project Breakdown
"Built this [system] using [tools]. Results inside."
- Full breakdown with numbers
- Before and after
- What you'd do differently

### AMA-Lite Thread
"Been using [tools] daily for [timeframe]. Ask me anything."
- Only works if you have real experience to share
- Engage with every reply

### List Post
"5 [tool] tips you won't find in the docs."
- Specific, non-obvious tips
- Each one has enough detail to act on

## Subreddit Targeting

### Tier 1: Directly Related
Find 3-5 subreddits where your exact audience hangs out. These are your primary targets.

Examples by niche:
- **AI/Dev tools**: r/ClaudeAI, r/CursorAI, r/ChatGPT, r/LocalLLaMA
- **Productivity**: r/Productivity, r/Notion, r/ObsidianMD
- **Business**: r/Entrepreneur, r/Startups, r/SaaS
- **Marketing**: r/DigitalMarketing, r/SEO, r/ContentMarketing

### Tier 2: Adjacent
Subreddits where your audience overlaps but the topic is broader.

### Tier 3: SEO-Heavy
Large subreddits where posts rank well in Google: r/NoStupidQuestions, r/ExplainLikeImFive, r/AskReddit

## Rules of Reddit (The Culture)

1. **Value first, always.** No links in post bodies unless they're genuinely helpful resources.
2. **Read the rules.** Every subreddit has specific posting rules. Mods ban fast.
3. **Don't post and ghost.** Engage with every comment on your post.
4. **No self-promotion.** Let your profile and post quality do the work. Hard CTAs get you banned.
5. **Karma matters.** Comment and engage before posting. New accounts with no history get filtered.
6. **Be honest about failures.** Reddit rewards "here's what went wrong" more than "here's my success."

## Cross-Posting from Other Platforms

| Source | Reddit Treatment |
|--------|-----------------|
| LinkedIn post | Rewrite conversationally. Strip the personal branding. Add more detail. |
| Substack article | Compress into a Reddit-native post. No newsletter formatting. |
| X thread | Expand each point. Reddit readers want depth, not compression. |

## What to Avoid

- Promotional language ("check out my newsletter", "subscribe for more")
- Corporate tone (buzzwords, jargon without context)
- Cross-posting the same content word-for-word from LinkedIn
- Posting without engaging in the community first
- Ignoring subreddit rules
- Using your Reddit account only for self-promotion (aim for 90% engagement, 10% own content)

## Soft Funnel Strategy

Your Reddit profile bio links to your newsletter or site. That's your funnel. No in-post CTAs needed. When people find your content valuable, they check your profile. Make sure your profile bio has a clear one-line description and a link.
