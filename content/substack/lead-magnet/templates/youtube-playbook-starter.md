## Platform DNA

YouTube is the depth layer. Where TikTok proves things in 16 seconds, YouTube gives you 10-20 minutes to actually teach. The platform rewards watch time, which means substance wins over clicks. A single well-made video can drive traffic for years.

In your system, YouTube serves as: a long-form education channel, an SEO engine for your brand, and the place where short-form viewers go deeper.

## Tone

- Conversational, like a screen-share with a colleague
- Confident but not lecturing
- Show your actual screen, actual tools, actual workflows
- Mistakes and debugging are content, not failures
- No "smash that subscribe button" energy

## Content Formats

### Full Walkthrough (10-20 min)
Step-by-step build of a workflow, system, or tool setup.
- Best for: tutorials, skill deep dives, system builds
- Screen recording with narration
- Show the real thing, not slides about the thing

### Condensed Demo (3-7 min)
Focused demo of one specific technique or tool feature.
- Best for: quick wins, tool tips, feature showcases
- Get to the point fast, no 2-minute intros
- One concept per video

### Build Log / Vlog (5-15 min)
Document what you're building as you build it.
- Best for: build-in-public content, project updates
- Raw and real, not over-produced
- Show the process, including the messy parts

### Reaction / First Look (5-10 min)
Your take on a new tool release, feature update, or industry trend.
- Best for: staying current, showing real-time builder perspective
- Record your first real experience with the thing
- Honest reactions, not sponsored energy

## Video Structure

### The Hook (0-30 sec)
What they'll learn or see. Why they should keep watching. No life story.
- "In this video I'm going to show you exactly how I [specific result]"
- Or: start with the result, then "let me show you how"

### The Setup (30 sec - 2 min)
Quick context. What tools are involved. What problem this solves.
- Keep it tight. Viewers came for the content, not the backstory.

### The Build (bulk of video)
The actual walkthrough. Screen recording, real tools, real data (anonymized if needed).
- Narrate what you're doing and why
- Call out gotchas and common mistakes
- Pause to explain non-obvious steps

### The Wrap (last 1-2 min)
What was built. What they can do next. Where to find resources.
- Link to related content (newsletter, other videos, templates)
- No desperate subscribe CTAs. If the content is good, they'll subscribe.

## Title and Thumbnail

### Titles
- Specific and searchable: "How I Built a Content Pipeline in Cursor (Full Walkthrough)"
- Include the tool name and the outcome
- Front-load the keyword (what people search for comes first)
- 50-70 characters ideal

### Thumbnails
- Show the result or the tool interface
- Large readable text (3-5 words max)
- Your face is optional (screen content often works better for tutorials)
- High contrast, clean layout

## Cross-Posting Strategy

| Source | YouTube Treatment |
|--------|------------------|
| LinkedIn post | Expand into a full walkthrough with screen recording |
| Substack article | Video version of the tactical breakdown |
| TikTok clip | Extended cut with more detail and explanation |
| Cursor skill | Full demo of the skill in action, from trigger to output |

## What to Avoid

- Long intros before getting to the content
- Slides instead of real screen recordings
- Over-produced transitions and effects (substance beats production)
- Clickbait titles that don't match the content
- Ignoring SEO (title, description, tags all matter for discovery)
- Posting without timestamps (viewers want to skip to what they need)

## Getting Started

You don't need fancy equipment:
- Screen recording: OBS (free), Loom, or native OS recording
- Editing: DaVinci Resolve (free), VEED, or Final Cut
- Microphone: Any USB mic beats laptop mic. Blue Yeti, Rode NT-USB, or even AirPods.
- Camera (optional): Phone camera is fine for talking-head segments
- Start with screen recordings + voiceover. Add camera later if it fits your style.
