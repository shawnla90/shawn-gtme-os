## the label

people started calling me the Clay guy.

I get it. I posted about Clay constantly. I built live on Clay. I showed the tables, the formulas,  the HTTP API setups. every GTM play I published had Clay at the center. and it worked.

heres the reality about being the tool guy. 

the tool changes. gets acquired. raises prices. deprecates features. ships something weird you don't agree with. and suddenly the identity you built is sitting on someone else's foundation.

I didn't want to be the Clay guy. I didn't want to be the Instantly guy or the HubSpot guy. I wanted to be the guy who builds systems. period. the tools are ingredients. they're not the recipe. and they're definitely not the chef.

## the real fear

I realized I was one rebrand away from having to rebuild my entire positioning. one API change from scrambling to explain why my content didn't work anymore. one competitor launch from being associated with the tool that's suddenly yesterday's news.

and it's not just career risk. it's creative risk. when your identity is tied to a tool, you start filtering every idea through that tool. you see everything as a clay problem or a hubspot problem. and you miss the bigger patterns. the ones that work across any tool.

I was building ceilings and calling them floors.

## two weeks ago

have to be honest with you.

two weeks ago I didn't know what a git repo was. not really. I knew the word. I'd heard engineers say it. but I didn't understand what it meant to version control your thinking. to commit your ideas. to build a system that describes itself.

I was an SDR who learned GTM from the grind up. 200+ cold emails a day. buying committees built by hand in Salesforce. my entire knowledge base lived in my head, in scattered Notion docs, and in Slack messages I'd never find again.

the system was me. and that was the problem.

because a system that only lives in your head can't scale. can't be shared. can't be improved while you're sleeping. it's just memory and muscle, and both of those degrade.

## the shift

what changed wasn't learning a new tool. it was learning that the system in your head can be externalized.

I started pulling things out of my head and putting them into files. how I sound when I write. how I approach each platform differently. the checks I run before I publish. the patterns I watch for in AI-generated content that make it sound fake. the pipeline I use to take an idea from draft to published across 6 platforms.

every file I wrote made the system a little less dependent on my memory. and every file I wrote made it a little more clear that this system wasn't about any one tool.

the voice file works whether I'm using Cursor or Claude Code or whatever comes next. the platform playbooks work regardless of which scheduling tool I use. the content pipeline works because it's built on markdown and folders, not on someone else's product.

the repo is just the container. but having a container changed everything.

## the awakening

your most valuable IP isn't your proficiency with a tool. 

it's the system you've built in your head over years of doing the work. the patterns you see. the shortcuts you've earned. the instincts you don't even think about anymore.

and most of that IP lives nowhere except your neurons.

the moment I started extracting it into a repo, three things happened.

first, I could see it. the system I'd been running unconsciously was suddenly visible. mapped out. file by file.

second, I could improve it. when something's in a file, you can version it. test it. share it with an AI and ask it to spot the gaps. try to do that with something that lives in your memory.

third, I realized the tools were just plugins. Clay is a plugin. Instantly is a plugin. Cursor is a plugin. they connect to the system. they don't define it.

I'm not the Clay guy. I'm not the Cursor guy. I'm the guy building a system that makes every tool work better because the thinking is already structured.

and two weeks into this, I'm by no means an expert. I'm learning Git commands by breaking things. I'm writing skill files that fail. I'm committing things I shouldn't and reverting things I should have kept. it's messy and it's fast and it's the most alive I've felt about my work in a long time.

## what's coming

this newsletter is going to be the journal of that build.

friday I'm sharing the specific discovery that changed everything. the moment a code editor stopped being a code editor and became the operating system I didn't know I needed.

and next Monday I'm giving you the scaffold to build your own. one prompt. three questions. a full repo architecture customized to your stack.

but today I just needed to say the thing out loud. your identity is not your tool. your system is not your memory. and the best time to start extracting it is before you need to.

the lab is open.
