\skill tree. git. blog. monorepo. three websites. two weeks. 

the plan was a blog. by sunday: three sites, shared design system, one.push /deploy. all. live. 

2 weeks ago i had no clue what a git repo was. not really. I’d heard the word. I knew engineers used it. but I didn’t understand what it meant to version control your thinking. to commit your ideas. to build a system that describes itself.

I was an SDR who learned GTM from the grind up. my entire knowledge base lived in my head, in scattered Notion docs, and in Slack messages I’d never find again.

the system was me. and that was the problem.

so I opened cursor. and claude code and built a meme generator. broke it. fixed it. 

broke it again. learned what a terminal actually was. learned what npm install meant. learned the difference between asking AI to build something for you and asking AI to show you how to build it while you’re driving.

that was the door.



## then I learned Git and everything got recursive

the meme generator worked. but the code was a mess. everything in one file. no structure. no way to track what changed. no way to go back if I broke something.

so I learned Git. and I don’t mean I learned the commands. I mean I learned the mental model.

version control isn’t just tracking changes. it’s thinking in systems. you version your outbound. you branch your experiments. you commit your wins and revert your failures. that’s not workflow management. that’s engineering.

and once you learn to think that way, you start seeing everything as a system that can be versioned.

my voice. my platform playbooks. my content pipeline. my GTM workflows. all of it could live in files. all of it could be tracked. all of it could be shared with AI as context instead of trying to explain it fresh every time.

so I started pulling things out of my head and putting them into markdown files.

how I sound when I write. how I approach each platform differently. the checks I run before I publish. the patterns I watch for in AI-generated content that make it sound fake. the pipeline I use to take an idea from draft to published across 6 platforms.

every file I wrote made the system a little less dependent on my memory. and every file I wrote made it a little more clear that this system wasn’t about any one tool.

the voice file works whether I’m using Cursor or Claude Code or whatever comes next. the platform playbooks work regardless of which scheduling tool I use. the content pipeline works because it’s built on markdown and folders, not on someone else’s product.

the repo became the container. but having a container changed everything.

## then I built a skill tree and it got competitive

here’s where it got fun.

I was building Cursor skills. little automation scripts that understand your context and generate drafts, finalize posts, push to platforms. slash commands that read your voice files and platform playbooks and turn ideas into content.

I had maybe 8 of them. and I realized I had no idea which ones I used most. which ones actually saved time. which ones I built and forgot about.

so I built a scoring system.

every day gets a log entry. what I built. what I shipped. how many words of content. how many commits. the tracker calculates an output score, assigns a letter grade, and tracks progression over time.

and then I added the RPG layer.

11 tiers from Terminal Initiate to Grand Master. 5 class specializations. Builder. Architect. Alchemist. Hybrid classes unlock at higher tiers. your title updates based on real output data. not vibes. not manual input. the system watches what you ship and tells you what tier you’re operating at.

I didn’t build this because gamification is trendy. I built it because I needed to see my own patterns. am I shipping? am I iterating? am I learning new skills or just running the same play?

the daily log gives me a report card. the progression system shows me if I’m stuck or advancing.

and it worked. because the moment you can see your output scored, you start making different decisions. you start asking better questions. you start thinking in systems instead of vibes.

the skill tree isn’t a game. it’s a mental model. and once you have the mental model, building becomes a feedback loop instead of a grind.

## then I learned monorepos and realized I could own everything

the plan was one website. shawnos.ai a blog. a landing page. a home for the system on the open web.

then I scoped the architecture. and something clicked. one site couldn’t hold all of it. the personal journey. the GTM engineering breakdowns. the content methodology. those are three audiences. three search intents. three domains.

shawnos.ai. thegtmos.ai. thecontentos.ai.

same repo. same terminal aesthetic. same shared design system. different accent color per site. green, amber, cyan. a Turborepo monorepo where one push deploys all three.

the plan rewrote itself while I was inside it. recursive.

## and then I realized LinkedIn is quicksand

I’ve been building on LinkedIn for months. posting every day. sharing workflows. showing the build. and it worked. the engagement was real. the reach was real. the connections were real.

but LinkedIn owns all of it.

the algorithm decides who sees it. the platform decides when to throttle reach. the company decides if your account gets flagged for posting too much or using the wrong words. your content lives on their servers under their rules and you have zero control.

same with Substack. I thought newsletters were better. owned audience, right? except Substack owns the distribution. Substack owns the subscriber list. Substack decides if you can export. Substack decides if your post gets featured.

working on LinkedIn is like working in quicksand. the harder you push, the deeper you sink. because every post you write is building equity for the platform, not for you.

the only thing you can own is your own blog.

your domain. your code. your content in markdown files version-controlled in a git repo. your deploy pipeline. your SEO. your RSS feed. your subscriber data. yours.

LinkedIn becomes a distribution channel. Substack becomes a syndication layer. but the canonical source. the thing Google indexes. the thing that survives if LinkedIn shuts down tomorrow or changes the algorithm or bans your account. that lives on your domain.

this weekend I deployed three sites from a monorepo. shawnos.ai is live. blog engine, daily build log, RPG progression page, skill guide, full tracker prompt. nothing gated. nothing locked behind an email capture. just the system, running on the open web.

thegtmos.ai and thecontentos.ai are still v.1 for now. but the architecture is there. shared components. shared design system. one push deploys all three. when I’m ready to activate them, it’s not a rebuild. it’s just adding content.

## what’s actually live right now

shawnos.ai is live. here’s what’s on it:

**the blog.** post zero is up. not a manifesto. just the first commit on what happens when you treat GTM like an engineering problem. more posts dropping this week.

**the daily build log.** every day gets a scored entry. what I built, what I shipped, how many words of content. the tracker calculates an output score, assigns a letter grade, and updates my RPG title. the receipts are public. all of them.

**the progression system.** 11 tiers from Terminal Initiate to Grand Master. 5 class specializations. the title you see on my avatar badge is the title the daily log earned. it’s not a game. it’s a scoring engine for consistent output.

**the skill guide.** explains how the scoring works. what earns XP. how titles unlock. how classes are assigned.

**the tracker prompt.** the full 280-line prompt that powers the daily log. copy-paste ready. nothing gated. nothing locked.

## the arc you can run yourself

meme generator. Git. skill tree. monorepo. three websites. owned infrastructure.

you don’t have to follow that exact path. but you can.

the tracker prompt is public. the RPG system is documented. the progression tiers are visible. the daily log shows exactly what I’m shipping and what score it earned.

I’m not saying build exactly what I built. I’m saying the arc is real. and if you want to run it, the receipts are there.

start with something you can break. build it. break it. fix it. learn Git. learn what version control actually means. pull your knowledge out of your head and into files. build a scoring system so you can see your own patterns. build something you can own.

the skill tree is the mental model. the monorepo is the architecture. the blog is the proof you can own your work instead of renting space on someone else’s platform.

and if you want to make it fun, turn it into an RPG. give yourself XP for shipping. track your progression. let the dragon tell you when you level up.

because the moment you can see your output scored, you start thinking in systems. and once you think in systems, you stop working in quicksand.

## the stack

for the builders who want specifics:

Turborepo: monorepo management across three Next.js apps
Next.js: framework for all three sites
Vercel: hosting, auto-deploys on push
Cloudflare: DNS
Cursor: the IDE where everything lives
Claude: the agent that helped architect and build it
markdown files: all blog posts and log entries are plain markdown
git: version control for everything, including content
Python: the scoring engine, the tracker, the progression calculator
Pillow: image generation for daily log cards

three weeks ago I built a meme generator. this weekend I deployed a three-site network from a code editor.

the system doesn’t require you to already know everything. it requires you to be willing to learn the next skill. and the next one. and the next one.

## what’s next

the moment a code editor stopped being a code editor and became an operating system. the 17-tab workflow that broke. the MCP layer that wired everything together. the architecture that makes this whole system run.

but right now, the system has a home. and you can visit it.

I’m also filming a full walkthrough this week. 15-20 minutes. the website, the build log, the progression system, the skill tree. screen-first, no slides, just the terminal and the thing running. I’ll drop the link when it’s live.

go poke around. check the daily log. look at the progression system. copy the tracker prompt if you want to run your own. nothing is gated.

if you’re building something from scratch too. something where you’re learning the next skill before you’ve mastered the last one. something where the plan keeps growing while you’re inside it. reply and tell me what it is. I read every single reply.

and if you want to see how this whole thing started. how a meme generator turned into a monorepo turned into a three-site network with an RPG scoring engine. stick around. this is just post 3.

the lab is open. shawn.os is live. dare to build. 😈
