## the return

last time I wrote here it was Inside the Lab on Beehiiv.

custom anime artwork. signal chaining deep dives. that was 9 months ago. I didn't stop working. I stopped broadcasting. and I started building.

what I built is worth showing you now.

## the bigger picture

here's what I keep thinking about. there's a new kind of GTM pro emerging right now. not ops people with spreadsheets. not SDRs with sequences. GTM engineers who understand Git. who version control their workflows. who build inside repos instead of slide decks.

I was an SDR who manually built buying committees in Salesforce. sent 200+ cold emails a day from primary domains with no warmup. learned GTM from the absolute grind up. and then I learned to really vibe code. and everything changed.

when you understand Git, you stop tracking changes and start thinking in systems. you version your outbound. you branch your experiments. you commit your wins and revert your failures. that's not workflow management. that's engineering.

and the timing is wild. MCPs are here. Model Context Protocol means your AI tools talk to each other natively. your IDE talks to your CRM. your content system talks to your outreach stack. your repo becomes the hub that connects everything.

this convergence. GTM engineers who know Git. MCP servers wiring tools together. AI that actually builds with you instead of just answering questions. it's unlocking something I genuinely believe most people haven't seen yet. and I'm living inside it every day.

## what I built

I have two operating systems inside one git repo.

the GTM OS runs pipeline infrastructure. Clay tables, HeyReach campaigns, Instantly sequences, partner handoffs, CRM syncs. the engine that builds revenue.

the content OS runs the entire content machine. voice DNA files, platform playbooks, 23 Cursor skills, 10 content pillars, publishing pipelines across 6 platforms. the engine that builds audience.

they live side by side. they feed each other. the GTM OS generates the stories. the content OS documents them. the content OS ships the plays. the GTM OS runs the pipeline they describe.

two weeks ago the content side was a chatbot or two or three that I was stringing up together that may have had a skill file attached to it with some brand resonance. today:

- 23 active Cursor skills
- 10 content pillars
- 6 platforms (LinkedIn, X, TikTok, Substack, YouTube, Reddit)
- 16 GTM plays documented
- full pipeline: IDEA to DRAFT to FINAL to PUBLISH to REPURPOSE

and it grows every single day. the system is structured enough that it can describe itself. one Python script reads the file tree and renders a full schematic. the repo drew its own picture.

## what OS.AI Labs is

this newsletter is the deeper layer.

LinkedIn is where I educate. quick plays, skill shares, build screenshots, tactical drops. that stays. I love that side.

but LinkedIn compresses everything into 1300 characters. the nuance gets cut. the thinking gets flattened. the story behind the build disappears.

OS.AI Labs is where the thinking lives. the reflections on what I'm building and why. the patterns I keep seeing in this GTM engineer emergence. the experiments that worked and the ones that broke. the under-the-hood version of what shows up as a screenshot on your feed.

this is not a broadcast. I share what I know on LinkedIn to educate. I come here to learn.

## the invitation

I know I'm not the only one building like this. GTM engineers learning Git. ops people discovering repos. builders wiring MCP servers into their daily workflows. content systems that live inside code editors instead of Notion boards.

I want to hear your story. what are you building? what tools are you connecting? what shifted for you when you stopped using spreadsheets and started versioning your systems?

reply to this email. tell me. I genuinely want to know.

this is Post 1 of OS.AI Labs. the lab is open. let's see what's out there.

if this resonated, forward it to someone building at the intersection of GTM and engineering. or reply and tell me what you're working on. I read every single reply.

the full repo structure, skill files, and schematic generator are documented. no gatekeeping. if you want to see how any of this works, just ask.
