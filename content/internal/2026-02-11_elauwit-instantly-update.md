# Internal Comms — Elauwit Instantly Campaign Update

**Re:** Instantly Campaign Export + Call Lists for John

---

Hey team, just a quick update.

Initially, I had misread the message and went ahead and pulled the HeyReach export — but I've now gone ahead and done the full Instantly campaign export as well.

As far as where things stand with the campaigns:

- **(Known Reviews) Co-Star WiFi Campaign** — fully completed. 96 leads went through the entire 4-step sequence with no real response.
- **(Unknown Reviews) Co-Star WiFi Campaign** — still active. ~1,222 contacts are still in the sequence. 276 have completed so far with no response.

I've gone ahead and enriched those lists — not only the Instantly exports but also the HeyReach lists — with mobile numbers and created a master call list that has the campaign labeled on it, ready for John to call. Most contacts have one, sometimes two mobile numbers given the targeted list. I was able to use a better provider for the enrichment this time around.

Lists are live in Instantly and CSVs are ready to go whenever John needs them.

Let me know if anything else is needed.
