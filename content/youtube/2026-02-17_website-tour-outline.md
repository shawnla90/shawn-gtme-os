## Title Options

1. I deployed three websites from a code editor in one weekend (full tour)
2. the website that scores my output like an RPG (live walkthrough)
3. meme generator to monorepo: the full build arc (15 min tour)
4. I built a skill tree, a scoring engine, and three sites. here's all of it.
5. from zero to three deployed sites: the vibe coding session nobody asked for

---

## Thumbnail Concept

Split screen. terminal on left, live shawnos.ai on right. text overlay: "3 sites. 1 repo. 3 weeks." Terminal should show an actual git push or deploy command. shawnos.ai should show the blog or progression page with the RPG tier visible. Dark background, green accent on terminal side, amber or white on the site side.

## Description (first lines)

three weeks ago I built a meme generator. this weekend I deployed three websites from a code editor. here's the full tour.

shawnos.ai is live. blog engine, daily build log, RPG progression system, skill guide, full tracker prompt. nothing gated. the monorepo deploys all three sites with one push.

links:
- shawnos.ai
- newsletter: shawntenam.substack.com
- the tracker prompt: [link to skill guide page]

chapters below.

## Video Structure

### 1. Cold Open (0:00-0:30)

Flash all three live sites. show the terminal. show a quick git push deploying everything.

**talking points:**
- "three weeks ago I didn't know what npm install meant. this is what's live right now."
- flash shawnos.ai, thegtmos.ai, thecontentos.ai in quick succession
- show the Vercel deploy dashboard with all three apps
- keep this fast. 30 seconds max. the output is the hook.

### 2. The Arc (0:30-3:00)

compressed version of the newsletter story. meme generator to git to skill tree to monorepo.

**talking points:**
- started with a YouTube tutorial on building a meme generator
- didn't finish the tutorial. finished three websites.
- the progression: meme generator > git > markdown files > skill tree > monorepo > three deployed sites
- show the repo file tree in Cursor. the full tree view. let them see the scale.
- "every skill you see in this tree is something I built because I needed it. not because someone told me to."

### 3. Website Tour: shawnos.ai (3:00-8:00)

walk through every page live. click through it. show what's real.

**talking points:**
- **the blog**: post zero is up. show the markdown-powered blog engine. click into a post. show the terminal aesthetic.
- **the daily build log**: show a scored entry. explain the output score, the letter grade, the RPG title. scroll through multiple days.
- **the progression system**: show the 11 tiers. show the class specializations. explain how your title updates based on actual output data.
- **the skill guide**: walk through how scoring works. what earns XP. how titles unlock.
- **the tracker prompt**: show the full 280-line prompt on the page. "copy this. run it. that's it."
- pause on the RPG progression page. "this isn't a game. it's a scoring engine. the dragon on my avatar badge is the dragon the daily log earned."

### 4. The Architecture (8:00-11:00)

show the monorepo structure. how it all connects.

**talking points:**
- show the Turborepo config. three Next.js apps. shared design system.
- show the folder structure: apps/shawnos, apps/thegtmos, apps/thecontentos, packages/shared-ui
- show a git push deploying all three sites at once on Vercel
- explain the accent color system: green (shawnos), amber (thegtmos), cyan (thecontentos)
- "one repo. one push. three sites. the architecture means adding content to any site is just adding a markdown file."
- show thegtmos.ai and thecontentos.ai as placeholders. "the architecture is live. the content is coming."

### 5. The Scoring Engine (11:00-14:00)

show the daily tracker running. the RPG system in action.

**talking points:**
- run the daily tracker live on screen. show it pulling git data, counting commits, calculating the score
- walk through the scoring formula. what counts as output. how words, commits, skills, and deploys factor in.
- show the letter grade calculation. show the RPG tier update.
- show the Pillow-generated daily log card. the visual output of the tracker.
- "the moment you can see your output scored, you start making different decisions. that's the whole point."
- show the progression over time if you have multiple days of data

### 6. "Try It Yourself" Moment (14:00-17:00)

the invitation. show how someone can run this.

**talking points:**
- go back to the tracker prompt on shawnos.ai. show it again.
- "copy this. open Cursor or Claude Code or whatever you use. paste it. run it. see what happens."
- show what happens when you run the prompt from scratch with zero context. what it asks for. what it produces.
- "you don't need my repo. you don't need my skill files. the prompt bootstraps itself."
- casual, no-pressure. "if you want to gamify your own output, this is the starting point."
- mention the skill guide page explains everything if they want to go deeper

### 7. What's Next + Close (17:00-18:00)

tease forward momentum. soft CTA.

**talking points:**
- "the full Cursor discovery story is coming this week. how a code editor became an operating system."
- tease the other two sites activating. thegtmos.ai getting GTM engineering content. thecontentos.ai getting content methodology breakdowns.
- "if you want the deep version of this build story, it's on the newsletter. link in the description."
- "if you're building something from scratch too, drop a comment. I read all of them."
- end on the terminal. maybe a final git push or the skill tree visualization.

## Voice Notes (per YouTube pillar)

- narrate like you're pair-programming with a friend
- "let me show you" not "in this video I'm going to show you"
- silence while navigating is fine. don't narrate every click.
- if something loads slow or breaks, leave it in. the fix is the content.
- speak to one person, not "you guys"
- no slides. screen-first. the terminal and the thing running.
