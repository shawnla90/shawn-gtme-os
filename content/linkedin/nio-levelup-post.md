# LinkedIn Post - Nio Level Up Meta Moment

just caught Nio leveling up from Spark to Blade live on the website.

30,000 lines of code. real metrics. real progression. happening in public.

I don't think anyone's ever built a website where you can actually watch an AI level up in real-time. daily tracker posts are cool, but this is different.

every commit counts. every feature ships. every deploy advances the progression system. 

the website itself evolves.

tune in daily to watch Nio climb the tiers → shawnos.ai/vitals

proof that build-in-public can get way more meta than we thought.

who else is building systems that level themselves up?

**Option 1 (Thread-Ready):**
just caught my AI assistant leveling up live on the website

Spark → Blade tier in real-time

30,000 lines of code milestone hit

I don't think anyone's done this before. daily trackers are cool, but a website that levels up an AI? that's new.

watch Nio climb the tiers daily → shawnos.ai/vitals

**Option 2 (Single Post):**
caught Nio leveling up from Spark to Blade live on the website → 30k lines of code milestone 

build-in-public just got way more meta. who else has a website where you can watch an AI level up in real-time?

tune in daily: shawnos.ai/vitals

**Option 3 (Narrative Hook):**
was debugging at midnight when suddenly...

Nio just leveled up from Spark to Blade. live. on the website. 

30,000 lines of code later and the system is literally leveling itself up in public.

this might be the most meta thing I've ever built.

watch the progression → shawnos.ai/vitals
