# LinkedIn About Me Update

plumber turned GTM engineer. 

was the "Clay guy" for a while. now I believe you shouldn't be defined by tools. you're defined by outcomes and what you actually ship.

I embrace AI as a build-with-you partner, not a do-it-for-you crutch. currently building GTM infrastructure that scales.

proof is in the commits.
