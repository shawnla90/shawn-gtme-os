# LinkedIn About Me Update

plumber turned GTM engineer.

was the "Clay guy" for a while. now I believe you shouldn't be defined by tools. you're defined by outcomes and what you actually ship.

I build in public. not the kind where you tweet about it. the kind where the code is live, the systems are running, and the receipts are on the website. every blog post, every automation, every commit.

I work with AI as a build partner, not a crutch. building GTM infrastructure, content systems, and ops layers that compound over time. shipping daily.

if you're curious what that looks like in practice, everything is out in the open.
