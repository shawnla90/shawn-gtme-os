the Final Fantasy 10 skill tree looks familiar.

not because i've been playing it recently. because i've been building one.

my repo is a skill tree. your repo is a skill tree. every GTM system is a skill tree.

here's the pattern i didn't see until last week:

when you're grinding through a game, you don't know what the full tree looks like. you just unlock one node at a time. you experiment. you try combinations. you see what works.

that's exactly how i built my repo. one skill file at a time. one MCP server at a time. one workflow at a time.

didn't know what i was building. didn't know what it would look like when it was done.

but the gamification kept me going. the unlocks. the XP. the progression.

probably a hundred hours in the last seven days. cursor crazy.

and here's what clicked: once you acquire these skills in the game, you own them. you can repeat them. you can use them in different combinations.

that's exactly what you're doing with your go-to-market system. your content system. your ad system.

you're building a skill tree. and once you unlock those abilities, they're yours.

it can be complicated. but if you were a gamer, this is all for you. this is your moment.

any GTM engineer or STR who fears these more advanced tools should know: either get in or get left behind.

if you're into RPGs or D&D, this is your way in.

if you're not a gamer but you're grabbing MD skills from every lead magnet post you see, you're basically unlocking that insanely OP ability. the clone skill that creates an army of copies that mirror your moveset.

you're collecting nodes for your tree. in a game, the tree is pre-built. in your repo, you're building it yourself.

the wild part is that i didn't even realize i was building a skill tree until i saw this image.

it clicked. all those hours grinding through Cursor. all those skill files. all those MCP servers.

it's the same loop. unlock. acquire. repeat.

if you're building GTM systems and you've never played an RPG, go play one. seriously.

you'll understand the progression loop. you'll understand why unlocks feel so good. you'll understand why building your own tree is addictive.
