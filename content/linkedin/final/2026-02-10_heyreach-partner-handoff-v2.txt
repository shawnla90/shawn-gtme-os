the gtm plays series just leveled up. part 16.

and no — i'm not dropping Clay. we're evolving.

this one runs on HeyReach's MCP. Cursor. LinkedIn recon. Slack. one workflow, chained.

here's the play:

✅ HeyReach MCP — pull accepted + unaccepted CSV from the campaign. two exports, one source of truth.

🔧 accepted list — run linkedin recon. deep research on every profile. recent posts, activity, personalization hooks. the caller gets context before the call, not a cold sheet.

➡️ unaccepted list — updated tab, current as of today. partner gets both. caller knows who to prioritize.

🧠 partner handoff — draft the message. attach the CSVs. ship. one skill orchestrates the whole thing.

the energy shift: more MCP, more Cursor, more the workflow versions itself. Clay still runs half my plays. 

but the stack is growing. and the plays are too.

Full heyreach-partner-handoff skill lives at .cursor/skills/heyreach-partner-handoff/SKILL.md — chains heyreach-export (MCP), linkedin-recon (browser), upload_heyreach_to_slack.py. Partner path: clients/partner/<partner>/resources/. Contax message drafts to resources/contax-<contact>-YYYY-MM-DD.md.

=== COMMENT 2 ===
Play 16 is the first "v2" play in the series — MCP + Cursor orchestration, not Clay-heavy. The shift: workflows that version in a repo, skills that chain other skills. Clay stays. We're expanding the stack.

=== COMMENT 3 ===
If you're running HeyReach campaigns and hand off to partners (SDRs, AEs, callers) — this play gives them accepted with recon context and unaccepted with an updated list. No more "which CSV is current."
