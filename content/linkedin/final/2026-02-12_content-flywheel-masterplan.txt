26 skills. 10 pillars. 6 platforms. 36 active drafts. 1 repo.

that's what the content operating system looks like today (diagram attached).

I don't write content in browser tabs. I don't maintain a Notion board. I don't paste prompts into ChatGPT and hope the formatting works.

I run slash commands inside a code editor.

/playdraft → screenshot becomes LinkedIn + X drafts
/finalcopy → draft becomes publish-ready plain text
/substackpost → topic becomes newsletter post #N
/xtip → one-liner becomes micro-tip thread
/tiktokscript → concept becomes 16-second storyboard
/imagecontent → image becomes 3 LinkedIn versions + 10-post X arc

every one of those skills inherits from the same voice DNA files. core-voice.md defines how I write. viral-hooks.md sharpens the openers. anti-slop.md catches AI patterns before they ship. platform playbooks handle the formatting per channel.

what you get is multi-threaded content output that all sounds like you.


the content side has:

⚡ 26 Cursor skills. each one a specialized workflow. /playdraft turns a screenshot into LinkedIn + X drafts. /finalcopy converts a markdown draft to publish-ready plain text. /substackpost generates newsletter content with automatic post numbering. /xtip produces micro-tip posts. /tiktokscript writes short-form video scripts.

🧠 3 voice tiers. core voice DNA, platform-specific playbooks, and content ops rules. every skill inherits from the same voice files. that means my LinkedIn posts, X threads, Substack essays, and Reddit posts all sound like me. not like ChatGPT doing a Shawn impression.

📡 6 platform outputs. LinkedIn, X, Substack, Reddit, TikTok, YouTube. each platform has its own formatting rules, CTA patterns, and hook styles. the skills know the difference.

10 content pillars structure the topics. a daily tracker auto-detects what I shipped. the whole thing versions itself through git.

right now there are 36 active drafts in the pipeline across all platforms. all generated from the same hub. all in my voice.

the master plan diagram attached shows the full architecture. voice tiers, skills engine, platform distribution, everything.

this is what happens when you stop treating content as a task and start treating it as a system.

=== COMMENT 1 (pipeline) ===
today's pipeline:
⚡ LinkedIn: 11+ drafts queued
⚡ X: 12+ drafts queued
📰 Substack: 4 posts in pipeline
🗣️ Reddit: 2 posts ready
🎬 TikTok: scripts queued
📺 YouTube: platform defined

and the daily tracker caught all of it automatically. git commits, new files, content directory scans. merged into a JSON log and rendered as a dashboard card.

two operating systems in one repo. GTM OS for pipeline. content OS for distribution. they feed each other.

the architecture diagram shows the full master plan. every skill, every tier, every platform.

=== COMMENT 2 (voice layer) ===
the voice layer is the part that changed everything. before I built the voice DNA files, every AI-generated draft sounded generic. now every skill reads the same 4 core files before it writes anything. the output sounds like me because it literally learned from my patterns, not a generic writing prompt.

here's what lives in the voice DNA:
→ core-voice.md (identity, tone, sentence patterns)
→ viral-hooks.md (scroll-stopping openers)
→ anti-slop.md (29 AI patterns to catch and fix)
→ safety-filters.md (client/partner name protection)

=== COMMENT 3 (flywheel) ===
the flywheel isn't theoretical. the GTM OS runs campaigns. Clay enrichment, HeyReach outreach, Instantly email sequences, partner handoffs. every one of those generates a story. the content OS documents those stories as plays, skill shares, build logs. those posts build audience. that audience feeds the GTM pipeline. loop.

=== COMMENT 4 (skill list) ===
full skill list for the curious:
play-draft, final-copy, substack-post, final-substack, x-tip, tiktok-script, viral-hooks, image-to-content, content-images, daily-tracker, skill-play, value-pin-comments, linkedin-comments, agent-context-handoff, heyreach-export, heyreach-handoff, heyreach-conversations, linkedin-recon, slack-sync, slack-mcp, slack-reminder, email-copy, instantly-replies, notion-sync, repo-stats, add-mcp

26 active. more queued. no gatekeeping. ask me about any of them.
