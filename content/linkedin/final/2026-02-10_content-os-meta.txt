[POST BODY]

i'm screen recording myself right now. talking to my IDE. and the play i'm showing is the content operating system — creating itself.

that's the meta angle. the system generates the post that documents the system.

here's how it actually works ⚡

🔧 cursor + claude code + a skill file called play-draft
🔗 i describe what i built, drop the pillar, hit enter
🧠 the skill loads voice DNA, pillar structure, formatting guides
➡️ it outputs 3 linkedin versions + 10 x tweets + comment thread content

all from "i built this, here's the screenshot, go."

no jumping between notion and docs. no "let me write this later." the build is the draft. the draft is the build.

if you're building in public but content creation feels like a separate job from the thing you're building — that's the gap this closes. your output becomes your content. the receipts are the post.

=== COMMENT 1 ===
the play-draft skill is in the repo. it reads a screenshot, loads pillar guides (plays series, building & sharing, skill/system shares), pulls voice DNA, and outputs markdown files to content/linkedin/drafts and content/x/drafts. the structure is all in the skill — the human provides context + pillar. that's it.

=== COMMENT 2 ===
no gatekeeping — the repo structure, skill files, and play index are all documented. if you want to adapt this for your own content system, start with the /playdraft flow. screenshot → context → pillar → drafts. the rest scales from there.

=== COMMENT 3 ===
building in public is only sustainable if content creation isn't a separate job. this is how i made it one job. if you're doing something similar, dm me. i want to see it.
