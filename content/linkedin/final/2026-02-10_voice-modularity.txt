just updated my voice rules in the middle of creating a post.

saw something I didn't like — lowercase I, too many I's, quotation marks. edited the skill file. the next draft already had it.

that's the modularity of a content operating system. not templates. not AI writing for you. the system writes WITH you. cursor's open, voice DNA is a markdown file. see something, change it, the change flows through.

the best way to craft your voice isn't to hand a style guide to a ghostwriter. it's to build a system that sits next to you while you write. you refine as you go. the system learns your preferences in real-time because you're editing the source.

this moment — updating a skill, then posting about the update — is the loop. meta af.

the voice files live in skills/tier-1-voice-dna and skills/tier-2-context-playbooks. core-voice.md is the source. linkedin.md and x-twitter.md inherit. when I add a formatting rule — like capitalize I, no quotes — it flows to play-draft, image-to-content, final-copy. one edit, all drafts.

=== COMMENT 2 ===
write-with vs write-for: write-for is you hand off a prompt and hope. write-with is you're in the loop, the system generates, you react, you refine the rules, it generates again. same session. the refinement is instant because the source is right there.

=== COMMENT 3 ===
if you want to build this, start with one skill file. write down how you want AI to write. your voice rules, your anti-patterns, what you never want to see. then use it. when something feels off, edit the file. that's the whole loop.
