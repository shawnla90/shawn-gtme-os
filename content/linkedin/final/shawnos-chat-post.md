two weeks ago I started building ShawnOS. a monorepo, three websites, agent skills, content pipelines. the operating system for a one-person GTM engine.

a week ago I stood up my AI agent Nio on OpenClaw. OpenClaw is GPT-based. separate system from the repo. it worked. but I was burning $50-200/month on API calls and running two disconnected systems.

then the insight hit: the repo is the magic. you don't need two systems.

Opus and Sonnet already speak with my repo. they read my soul files, my commit history, my content pipeline. they amplify my voice and DNA in a way GPT can't. in another world, OpenClaw would have been built on Anthropic instead of GPT. but it wasn't. and that gap made the answer obvious.

Claude Code Max. $200/month flat. unlimited CLI access. I was already paying for it to build the repo. the same CLI could power a chat interface.

so I built one. Next.js app. one API route. spawn the Claude CLI as a child process. stream the response back to the browser. Cloudflare Tunnel to my Mac Mini so I can chat from my phone. one afternoon.

the recursive nature is what makes it work. Claude builds the system that Claude powers. the model that writes the code is the model that runs inside it. that's not a cost optimization. that's a flywheel.

then I expanded it. different personality files for different agents. ops. system design. content creation. same CLI. same zero marginal cost. separate sessions, memory, personalities.

the pattern matters more than the code. if your AI runs on a platform that doesn't speak with your codebase, you're building two systems when you only need one.

this is ShawnOS. started building the repo two weeks ago. already compounding.
