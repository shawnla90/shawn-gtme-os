## Version 1: The Identity Trap (Contrarian)

people kept calling me the Clay guy.

and I let it happen. I posted about Clay every day. I built live on Clay. I showed the tables, the formulas, the full workflows. and it worked. the label stuck.

but then I realized something that changed how I think about every tool I use.

my identity was sitting on someone else's foundation.

one acquisition. one API change. one competitor launch. and the positioning I spent months building? gone.

so I stopped being the tool guy.

I started building a system that lives in a repo. not tied to Clay. not tied to Cursor. not tied to anything except the thinking I've developed over years of doing the actual work.

tools plug in and out. the system stays.

I wrote about the full identity shift and what I'm building instead in today's OS.AI Labs post. link in the first comment.

two weeks ago I didn't know what a git repo was. today it holds my entire operating system. that's the story.

## Version 2: The Two Weeks Confession (Vulnerability + Build)

two weeks ago I didn't know what a git repo was.

I'm not exaggerating. I knew the word. I'd heard engineers say it in meetings. but I didn't understand what it meant to version control your thinking.

my entire system lived in my head. scattered Notion docs. Slack messages I'd never find again. muscle memory that couldn't be shared or scaled.

then I started pulling it out. file by file.

how I sound when I write. how I approach each platform. the checks I run before publishing. the patterns I watch for in AI content. the pipeline I use to go from idea to published.

every file I wrote made the system less dependent on my memory. and made it clear that the system was never about any one tool.

I was the Clay guy. I didn't want to be.

the full story of this identity shift is in today's OS.AI Labs post. link in the first comment.

your most valuable IP isn't your tool proficiency. it's the system in your head that you've never written down.

## Version 3: The Ceiling Metaphor (Pattern Recognition)

the tool you're known for is the ceiling you don't see.

I was the Clay guy. and I was proud of it. until I realized my entire positioning was built on someone else's product.

here's what nobody tells you about becoming the tool expert.

the tool changes. gets acquired. raises prices. deprecates features. and suddenly the identity you built is sitting on ground you don't own.

I started asking a different question. what if the system mattered more than any individual tool? what if I could take everything in my head and put it somewhere that doesn't depend on any single company surviving?

that question led me to something I didn't expect. a git repo that holds my entire GTM and content operating system. tools plug into it. they don't define it.

I'm two weeks into this. by no means an expert. but the shift in thinking has been the biggest unlock of my career.

## First Comment (Value Pin)

today's OS.AI Labs post is the identity story behind what I'm building.

not the tools. not the tech. the moment I realized being known for one tool was the ceiling I couldn't see.

the full essay is here: [Substack link]

Friday I'm sharing the specific discovery that changed everything. and Monday I'm dropping the scaffold prompt so you can build your own.

three posts. one arc. the lab is open.

## Notes

- **Subject line impact**: When this Substack link renders on LinkedIn, the title card is the hook. Top subject line candidates that work as LinkedIn preview cards:
  - "I was the Clay guy. I didn't want to be." (strongest identity/curiosity hook)
  - "the tool you're known for is the ceiling you don't see" (pattern recognition)
  - "your identity shouldn't have a software dependency" (contrarian/punchy)
- **Version recommendation**: Version 1 (Identity Trap) or Version 3 (Ceiling Metaphor) are the strongest for engagement. Version 2 (Two Weeks Confession) is the most vulnerable and could drive the deepest connection.
- **Preview card**: Make sure the Substack post has a clear visual (repo file tree) so the preview card on LinkedIn has an image, not just text.
