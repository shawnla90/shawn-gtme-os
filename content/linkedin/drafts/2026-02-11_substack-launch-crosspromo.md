## Hook Options

1. **(Contrarian)** everyone's downloading someone else's AI templates. that's the ceiling, not the floor.

2. **(Problem-First)** your AI content sounds like everyone else's because it IS everyone else's. same prompts. same templates. same voice that belongs to nobody.

3. **(Data Bomb)** 23 skills. 15 MCP connections. 6 platforms. 10 content pillars. one repo. and none of it was trained on anyone else's voice.

4. **(Direct Challenge)** if your content system breaks when the tool changes, you don't have a system. you have a dependency.

5. **(Story Opener)** I spent 9 months building something I wasn't sure anyone would care about. then I realized that was the point.

## Variant A — Customization Angle (Primary)

everyone's downloading someone else's AI templates. that's the ceiling, not the floor.

I built something different.

not a template database. not a prompt library someone else curated. a system that starts with YOU. your voice. your tools. your platforms. your workflows.

here's what's inside:

→ a voice DNA layer that captures how YOU sound. not how some influencer sounds. your patterns, your instincts, your tone shifts across platforms.

→ skills that automate the reps. draft a post, finalize it, generate hooks, push to Typefully, sync to Notion. 23 of them wired into the repo.

→ MCP servers connecting everything. Instantly for email. HeyReach for LinkedIn. Substack for the newsletter. Reddit for community. Slack, Google Sheets, Firecrawl, and more. 15+ integrations talking through one system.

→ platform playbooks that know the difference between how you write on LinkedIn vs X vs TikTok vs Substack. because your voice isn't one-size-fits-all.

and here's the part most people miss.

this isn't just a content system. it's a GTM operating system. wire it for outbound. wire it for ads. wire it for product launches. the architecture is the same. voice DNA at the core. playbooks adapting per channel. skills automating the work.

the tools are plugins. Clay, Cursor, Instantly, HubSpot. they connect to the system. they don't define it. when the tool changes, the system keeps running because the thinking is already structured.

I documented the whole thing on Substack. how it works. why I built it this way. and the moment I realized being the tool guy was a ceiling I didn't see.

and I'm giving you the scaffold to build your own.

one prompt. three questions. a full repo architecture customized to your stack. plus the MCP connection guide and starter templates for every platform.

comment "my skill" and I'll send you the full kit.

I say "my skill" because that's the whole point. this becomes YOUR skill. not mine. not someone else's database. yours.

I'll be honest. if you've followed me for any amount of time, you know I don't gatekeep. prompts in the comments. formulas in the comments. full docs in the comments. always.

asking you to comment to get this feels contradictory to everything I've built here. but LinkedIn doesn't care about your values. you either play the algorithm or you don't get heard. so here we are.

the kit is real. the system is real. and it's built to be yours from day one.

## Variant B — Breadth Angle

your AI content sounds like everyone else's because it IS everyone else's. same prompts. same templates. same voice that belongs to nobody.

I stopped using other people's systems 9 months ago.

instead I built a repo. one repo that runs content, outbound, ads, partner ops, and product launches through the same architecture.

the core is simple.

voice DNA → how you sound. extracted from your actual writing patterns, not a generic tone slider.

playbooks → how you adapt per platform. LinkedIn gets the reflective builder tone. X gets the compressed punch. TikTok gets the 16-second hook. Substack gets the breathing room.

skills → 23 automated workflows. screenshot something you shipped? /playdraft turns it into a post. post ready? /finalcopy pushes it to Typefully. need hooks? /viralhooks gives you 5 options. need an image? /contentimage generates one.

MCPs → 15+ tool connections. Instantly, HeyReach, Slack, Substack, Reddit, Typefully, Notion, Firecrawl, Google Sheets. all wired into the repo. all talking to each other.

the magic isn't any one of those layers. it's that they stack.

voice DNA feeds the playbooks. playbooks feed the skills. skills use the MCPs. one system. every channel. every motion.

and every piece of it is customizable. swap the tools. add your platforms. bring your voice. the architecture holds because it's built on structure, not on someone else's product.

I just launched the newsletter breaking down exactly how all of this works. the architecture. the identity shift behind it. and the scaffold to build your own.

comment "my skill" and I'll send you the full starter kit.

the scaffold prompt. the MCP guide. the platform templates. everything you need to build your own version.

I call it "my skill" because that's the point. it's not my system you're copying. it's YOUR skill you're building.

real talk. I don't gatekeep. ever. it's in my brand. it's in my skill files. putting this behind a comment feels wrong. but LinkedIn's algorithm doesn't reward generosity. it rewards engagement. so this is the trade-off: comment to get the goods. not because I want to hide it. because the platform demands it.

the system is open. the build is documented. and it starts with your voice, not mine.

## Variant C — Identity/Voice Angle

if your content system breaks when the tool changes, you don't have a system. you have a dependency.

I learned this the hard way.

people started calling me the Clay guy. the Instantly guy. every post was about the tool. the identity was the tool. and I didn't see the problem until I realized I was one rebrand away from having to rebuild my entire positioning.

so I pulled everything out of my head and put it into files.

how I sound when I write. how I shift tone between LinkedIn and X and TikTok. the checks I run before I publish. the patterns I watch for in AI-generated content that make it sound fake. the pipeline I use to take an idea from draft to published across 6 platforms.

every file made the system less dependent on any single tool. and every file made it more clear that the system was never about the tools at all.

here's what it looks like now:

→ tier 1: voice DNA. your core voice extracted into files. not a template. YOUR patterns, YOUR instincts, YOUR platform adaptations.

→ tier 2: playbooks. how the voice adapts per platform, per audience, per content type.

→ tier 3: content ops. pillars, checklists, substance requirements, capture systems. the operational layer.

→ 23 skills. automated workflows for drafting, finalizing, hook generation, image creation, cross-platform publishing.

→ 15+ MCP connections. every tool in the stack talking through the repo. Instantly, HeyReach, Typefully, Substack, Reddit, Slack, Notion. all of it wired.

and it's not just content. the same architecture runs outbound campaigns, partner handoffs, and pipeline reporting. different skills, same system.

I documented everything on Substack. the identity shift. the architecture. the builds. the fails.

and I'm giving you the prompt to build your own.

comment "my skill" and I'll send you the scaffold.

one prompt. three questions. full repo architecture tailored to your stack, your platforms, your voice. plus the MCP connection guide and platform starter templates.

my skill. because that's what it becomes. not my voice running your system. YOUR voice. YOUR skill. built from scratch on you.

you know me. no gatekeeping. ever. I put prompts in comments, formulas in comments, full docs in comments. gating this behind a comment goes against everything I stand for.

but LinkedIn doesn't give a fuck about your values. either play the game or don't get heard. so here's the honest deal. comment and I'll send everything. no upsell. no funnel. just the kit.

## Comment Thread Content

**Comment 1 (pin this):**

the no-gatekeeping part is real. here's what you're getting:

→ the scaffold prompt — one prompt, three questions, builds your entire repo architecture
→ the MCP connection guide — GTM, content, and full-stack integrations explained
→ platform starter templates — playbooks for LinkedIn, X, TikTok, Reddit, YouTube
→ the anti-slop checklist — 29 AI writing patterns to catch before you publish

comment "my skill" on the post and I'll DM you the link.

this is the same architecture running my content, my outbound, and my partner ops. it's not a course. it's not a paid community. it's the actual system.

## Notes

- The "my skill" CTA is intentional — the phrase IS the message (your skill, not mine)
- No-gatekeeping acknowledgment is woven into every variant, not bolted on
- Each variant can pair with any of the 5 hooks — swap the first line
- Image should show the branching architecture (voice DNA → skills → MCPs → platforms)
- The comment thread delivers the specifics of what they're getting
- This post needs to carry weight on its own, not just point to Substack
