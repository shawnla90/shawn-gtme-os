## Option A (the title callback)

when I say I'm building cool stuff with Cursor and Claude Code — this is what I mean.

the screens say the rest. more coming next week.

---

## Option B (the "actually" frame)

actually building in public. not the tweet-about-it kind.

one repo. Friday afternoon. the screens tell the story.

---

## Option C (shortest — let the image work)

this is what "building cool stuff with Cursor and Claude Code" looks like on a Friday.

more to come.

## Value Pin Comments

### Comment 1 (the breadcrumb)

look closely — there's more than one site on that screen. none of them existed last week.

### Comment 2 (the forward tease)

hardware arrives next week. the infrastructure is about to get a lot more interesting.

## Internal Notes

- The post is the TEASER. 4 lines max. the screenshot does the explaining.
- Easter eggs in the screenshot for anyone paying attention: three sites (one live, two coming), daily tracker with A+ score, GitHub commits, Vercel deploy.
- Comment 1 rewards the people who zoom in. Comment 2 seeds the Mac Mini / Neobots arc without naming them.
- This is a two-way street post: short enough that most people scroll past with a like, deep enough that builders notice the details.
- Full reveal comes later. this is the breadcrumb drop.
- Do NOT explain what the three sites are. let the screen speak.
