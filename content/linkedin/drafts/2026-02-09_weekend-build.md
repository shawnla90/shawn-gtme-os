## Post Body

every GTM team I talk to has the same problem -- tribal knowledge lives in someone's head.

this weekend that problem got solved with two operating systems inside Cursor. not apps. not dashboards. operating systems for running GTM and creating content.

let me show you what's in them.

⚡ **the Go-To-Market Operating System**

a git repo that holds everything I need to run outbound for any client:

→ client folders with ICP research, personas, prompt libraries, and campaign workflows
→ 15 documented plays running daily (Clay + HubSpot + Instantly + the full stack)
→ MCP server automations -- Instantly reply fetching, LinkedIn recon via Browserbase, HeyReach campaign exports, Slack alerts
→ every workflow versioned, every prompt documented, every pattern captured

one repo. four active clients. zero tribal knowledge.

🧙‍♂️ **the Content Operating System**

a 3-tier skill tree that teaches AI how to write like me:

→ **tier 1 - voice DNA**: core voice principles, a 29-pattern AI slop detector, safety filters
→ **tier 2 - context playbooks**: platform-specific rules for LinkedIn, X, YouTube
→ **tier 3 - content ops**: 5 content pillars with templates, a pre-publish checklist, a capture system that pipes ideas from Slack into markdown

every post I write now runs through skill files before it hits your feed. the AI reads them first. it knows my voice, my anti-patterns, which pillar I'm writing in, and what my audience cares about.

it's not "AI writing my content."

it's AI operating inside my system.

here's the part that gets me.

a little over two years ago I was an SDR sending 200+ emails a day manually from SalesLoft. 14 months ago I went out on my own. now I'm building the systems that automate what I used to do by hand.

the same arc is happening with content. I used to write every post from scratch. now I have an operating system that makes every post better, faster, and more consistent -- without losing the voice.

Cursor + Claude Code + skill files + MCP servers = infrastructure that versions itself.

this is the start. not the finish.

next up: YouTube walkthroughs of the plays series. Cursor build sessions. the full system shared publicly.

building in public means you see the mess and the wins.

follow along if you want to see how it plays out.

## Comment Thread Content

**Comment 1:**
that tree in the image? that's the actual repo structure. left side is the GTM OS (client management, plays, automations). right side is the Content OS (voice DNA, playbooks, content ops).

both live in the same repo. both version-controlled with git. everything's in one place.

**Comment 2:**
people keep asking what tools I'm using, so here's the stack that makes it work:

→ Cursor (IDE -- where everything lives)
→ Claude Code (AI that reads the skill files)
→ MCP servers (Model Context Protocol -- connects AI to Slack, Instantly, LinkedIn, HeyReach)
→ Git (version control for the whole system)
→ Clay + HubSpot + Instantly (the GTM stack the OS orchestrates)

happy to go deeper on any of these.

**Comment 3:**
if you want to build something like this, start with one skill file. just one. write down how you want AI to write for you. your voice rules, your anti-patterns, what you never want to see.

that single file changes everything.

more on the full system coming soon. no gatekeeping ✌

- Attach tree visualization image to post
- This is the flagship post -- longer format is appropriate for LinkedIn
