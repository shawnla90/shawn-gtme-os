## Version 1: The Builder Story

i love what's possible now. MCPs, AI agents, repos that version your entire GTM stack. but here's the thing nobody talks about when you're deep in the builder flow: if your repo holds skills, plays, and workflows — especially with partners or clients in the mix — learning git and github correctly isn't optional. it's survival.

i committed myself to learning it the right way. not rushing. not shipping until i understood what i was actually pushing.

the screenshot? that's a pre-push safety scan. blocklist check, .gitignore audit, commit history review, webhook and token scans. everything clean before anything touches the remote. that scan is my peace of mind. it means i can open my github, see my skills, see my plays, and know that nothing sensitive is leaving my machine.

for GTM engineers building repos — this world is new. the unlocks are endless. but so is the learning curve. don't skip the fundamentals. take your time. get the basics right. the alternative is burning trust, burning relationships, and losing everything you thought you were protecting.

## Version 2: The Process Angle

the MCPs are insane. cursor, claude code, a repo that holds your entire operating system. but here's the messy reality: none of it matters if you're pushing to github without knowing what you're actually committing.

i spent weeks getting this wrong before i got it right. learning .gitignore. understanding blocklists. building a pre-push scan that checks every commit before it touches origin. the screenshot shows the output: blocklist clean, emails clean, webhooks and tokens clean, .gitignore audited, commit history scanned. nothing to push — repo is clean and current.

that workflow exists because i burned time (and nearly burned trust) early on. i was so excited to ship that i almost shipped things i shouldn't have. now? i have peace of mind. i can go into my github, see my skills, see my plays, and know exactly what's safe and what isn't.

if you're a GTM engineer with a repo — or thinking about it — don't rush. the unlocks are endless. so is what can go wrong if you skip the basics. learn git. learn github. learn how to update it properly. it's the foundation everything else sits on.

## Version 3: The Pattern Recognition

most GTM engineers i know are building repos now. skills as code. plays as workflows. MCPs stitching everything together. it's a new world and the possibilities are wild. but there's a pattern i keep seeing: people jump in before they've learned the fundamentals.

i did too. until i committed to learning git and github correctly. not the tutorial level. the real level. what actually gets pushed. what stays local. how to audit before you ship. the screenshot is a pre-push safety scan — blocklist, .gitignore, commit messages, token and webhook checks. all clean. that scan is why i can open my github with peace of mind. skills visible. plays visible. nothing sensitive leaking out.

the insight: the unlocks are endless. but so is the cost of getting it wrong. burn tokens, burn contacts, burn trust — it happens when you move fast without the basics. GTM engineers with repos: this is new territory. take your time. learn it right. the foundation matters more than the speed.

## Comment Thread Content

**Comment 1:**
the pre-push scan runs blocklist checks (8 terms), .gitignore audit, commit history review, and scans for emails, webhooks, API tokens, phone numbers. runs via /update-github before any push. keeps my skills and plays in the repo without ever leaking partner or client data.

**Comment 2:**
no gatekeeping — the skill file lives in the repo. dm me if you want the structure or you're building something similar and want to compare notes.

**Comment 3:**
if you're leveling up from spreadsheets to repos and figuring out git: take the weekend. read the docs. get comfortable with .gitignore and branch hygiene. worth every hour.

## Notes

Screenshot: Terminal with Pre-Push Safety Scan output — blocklist (8 terms) CLEAN, email addresses CLEAN, webhooks/tokens/phone CLEAN, .gitignore audit complete, commit history (last 20) CLEAN, working tree clean and up to date. User ran /update-github. Key angle: Building & Sharing — personal commitment to learning Git/GitHub correctly for GTM repos with sensitive info. Emphasize peace of mind, skills/plays visibility, no rushing, endless unlocks. Avoid specifics on partners/clients. Pillar: narrative, reflective, longer sentences, invitation to learn.
