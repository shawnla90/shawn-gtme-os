today I'm building a website from scratch inside a code editor.

no Squarespace. no drag-and-drop. the whole site lives in a git repo and deploys automatically when I push to GitHub.

the content OS is getting its fifth platform. LinkedIn, X, Substack, Reddit. and now shawnos.ai.

the domain wasn't just available. it was a puzzle. Shawn OS. personal operating system, powered by AI. but then I pulled it apart. S.H.A.W.N. Self-Hosted AI Workspace Node.

I didn't engineer that. the backronym describes exactly what the system is. sometimes the system names itself.

the stack: Cloudflare for DNS. Vercel for hosting. Next.js for the framework. markdown files for the blog. same pattern as everything else in the repo.

I've never registered a domain. never configured DNS. never touched Next.js.

two weeks ago I didn't know what a git repo was.

the system doesn't require you to already know everything. it requires you to be willing to learn the next skill.

full build story and the deeper breakdown is on Substack. link in the comments.

## Internal Notes

- This is the lightweight friday LinkedIn drop. not heavy promo.
- Link to Substack Post 3 in first comment.
- Visual: screenshot from the build (Cursor workspace, terminal, file tree).
- Keep it short. the depth lives on Substack.
- Monday's Cursor Discovery post (Post 4) gets the heavier LinkedIn treatment.
