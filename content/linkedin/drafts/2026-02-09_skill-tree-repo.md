## Version 1: The Gamer Hook

this looks familiar.

Final Fantasy 10 skill tree. spent probably a hundred hours grinding through this thing when i was younger.

didn't know what i was doing. didn't know what building a skill tree looked like. but the gamification kept me hooked. the unlocks. the XP. the progression.

fast forward to last week.

i'm building a repo. didn't know what building a repo was when i started. didn't know what it looked like.

but here's what clicked: once you acquire these skills in the game, you own them. you can repeat them. you can use them in different combinations.

that's exactly what you're doing with your go-to-market system. your content system. even your ad system.

you're building a skill tree.

every MCP server you add? that's a new ability unlocked. every skill file you write? that's a node on your tree. every workflow you automate? that's a combo move.

it can be complicated. but hey, if you were a gamer, this is all for you.

this is your moment. this is your chance.

any GTM engineer or STR who fears these more advanced tools should know: either get in or get left behind.

at the same time, if you're somebody who's into RPGs or Dungeons & Dragons, this is your way in.

i'm sure i'm not the only one who sees that.

but here's the thing: if you're not a gamer, just realize that if you're out there grabbing MD skills from every lead magnet post you see, you're basically unlocking an insanely OP ability. like that Final Fantasy skill that lets you cast a massive fireball that hits three targets at once. or the clone ability that creates an army of copies that mirror your moveset.

you're collecting abilities. you're building your tree.

in a game, the tree is pre-built. in your repo, you're building it yourself.

## Version 2: The Builder Angle

i didn't know what building a repo was when i was building one.

i didn't know what building a skill tree looked like when i was grinding Final Fantasy 10.

but the gamification is what immersed me. enabled me to spend probably a good hundred hours in the last seven days going cursor crazy.

on top of all the unlocks and continued XP, the fact is: one of my key favorite parts about doing these skill trees and games was that once you acquire these skills, you really own them. and you were able to repeat them.

that's exactly what you're doing with your go-to-market system. or your content system. or even an ad system.

there are so many ways to use your repo for you.

it can be a little complicated. but hey, if you were a gamer, this is all for you. this is your moment. this is your chance.

so any GTM engineer or SDR who fears these more advanced tools should know that either get in or get left behind.

at the same time, if you're somebody who's into anything that ever acquired playing an RPG game, this or Dungeons and Dragons, this is your way in.

i'm sure i'm not the only one who sees that.

but again, if you're not a gamer, just realize that if you're out there grabbing MD skills from every lead magnet post you see, you're basically unlocking that insanely OP ability. the one that lets you clone yourself and attack with an army of copies that mirror your moveset and special abilities.

that's part of it.

what's key here is that you're building your own skill tree. and once you unlock those abilities, they're yours. forever.

## Version 3: The Pattern Recognition Take

the Final Fantasy 10 skill tree looks familiar.

not because i've been playing it recently. because i've been building one.

my repo is a skill tree. your repo is a skill tree. every GTM system is a skill tree.

here's the pattern i didn't see until last week:

when you're grinding through a game, you don't know what the full tree looks like. you just unlock one node at a time. you experiment. you try combinations. you see what works.

that's exactly how i built my repo. one skill file at a time. one MCP server at a time. one workflow at a time.

didn't know what i was building. didn't know what it would look like when it was done.

but the gamification kept me going. the unlocks. the XP. the progression.

probably a hundred hours in the last seven days. cursor crazy.

and here's what clicked: once you acquire these skills in the game, you own them. you can repeat them. you can use them in different combinations.

that's exactly what you're doing with your go-to-market system. your content system. your ad system.

you're building a skill tree. and once you unlock those abilities, they're yours.

it can be complicated. but if you were a gamer, this is all for you. this is your moment.

any GTM engineer or STR who fears these more advanced tools should know: either get in or get left behind.

if you're into RPGs or D&D, this is your way in.

if you're not a gamer but you're grabbing MD skills from every lead magnet post you see, you're basically unlocking that insanely OP ability. the clone skill that creates an army of copies that mirror your moveset.

you're collecting nodes for your tree. in a game, the tree is pre-built. in your repo, you're building it yourself.

## Comment Thread Content

**Comment 1:**
the wild part is that i didn't even realize i was building a skill tree until i saw this image.

it clicked. all those hours grinding through Cursor. all those skill files. all those MCP servers.

it's the same loop. unlock. acquire. repeat.

**Comment 2:**
if you're building GTM systems and you've never played an RPG, go play one. seriously.

you'll understand the progression loop. you'll understand why unlocks feel so good. you'll understand why building your own tree is addictive.
