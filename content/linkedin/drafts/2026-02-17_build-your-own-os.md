## Version 1: Problem-Solution Hook

I had 17 tabs open and my laptop was frozen.

not "slow." frozen.

Instantly in one tab. HubSpot in another. Clay. Slack. Google Sheets. LinkedIn. a Notion doc I hadn't touched in three weeks. and I was supposed to be the guy building efficient GTM systems.

the problem wasn't the tools. every tool was fine on its own. the problem was the switching. every context switch cost me 5 minutes of re-orienting. every time I needed data from one tool in another, I copy-pasted. every time I wanted to remember how I set something up, I dug through old Slack threads.

so I stopped. and I built something different.

I built a modular operating system inside a code editor. one repo. version controlled. with MCP servers connecting every tool natively. no more tabs. no more copy-pasting. no more context switching.

today I'm sharing the scaffold prompt that builds the whole thing.

one prompt. paste it into Claude Code or Cursor. answer 3 questions. it builds:

✅ the 3-tier skill architecture (voice DNA, platform playbooks, content ops)
✅ content pipeline folders for every platform you use
✅ a proper .gitignore so you never leak client data
✅ a README that explains the system
✅ starter templates for X, Reddit, TikTok, YouTube
✅ an AI slop detection checklist
✅ an MCP connection guide matched to your stack

this is not my repo. it's a prompt that builds yours. based on your tools, your platforms, your brand.

I also recorded a full video walkthrough of me running the prompt from scratch. empty folder to finished repo. so you can see exactly what gets built before you try it.

the scaffold prompt, MCP guide, security guide, video walkthrough, and all 5 platform templates are in Monday's OS.AI Labs newsletter (Post 3).

link in the first comment.

one thing I want to be clear about. the scaffold gives you the architecture. it doesn't give you the skill. if you think one prompt makes you a Cursor power user overnight, it doesn't work that way. I'm still learning this every day. mastery comes from building, not from copying.

the prompt gives you somewhere to put things. you build the rest.

no gatekeeping ✌

## Version 2: Contrarian Hook

most people building GTM and content systems are using the wrong infrastructure.

Notion databases. Google Drive folders. Slack threads with links to docs nobody reads. spreadsheets tracking spreadsheets.

none of it is version controlled. none of it talks to your other tools natively. none of it grows with you in a structured way.

I spent 14 months building a different way. a git repo that runs both my GTM operations and my content machine. 23 Cursor skills. 10 content pillars. 6 platforms. MCP servers wiring everything together. the repo IS the operating system.

today I'm sharing the scaffold prompt so you can build your own.

it doesn't copy my system. it asks you 3 questions and builds a repo customized to your stack:

🔧 your platforms (LinkedIn, X, Substack, Reddit, TikTok, YouTube)
🔧 your tools (Clay, HubSpot, Instantly, whatever you use)
🔧 your brand (the voice file template is yours to fill in)

plus: MCP guide by stack type. security layer guide. AI slop detection checklist. platform playbook starters. and a full YouTube video of me running the prompt from scratch so you can see it before you try it.

the full package is in OS.AI Labs Post 3 (my Substack). link in the first comment.

this isn't a shortcut. the scaffold gives you architecture. the skill comes from building inside it every day. but you'll know where everything goes from day one.

no gatekeeping ✌

## Version 3: Build-in-Public Hook

I gave away the prompt that builds my entire operating system.

well... the architecture. not the voice DNA. not the 24 Cursor skills. not the full AI slop detection system. those you build yourself.

but the structure? the directory tree? the 3-tier skill system? the content pipeline? the MCP connection guide? the security layer?

all of it. one prompt. paste into Claude Code or Cursor. answer 3 questions. it scaffolds the whole repo customized to your tools and platforms.

in Post 1 of OS.AI Labs I showed you what I built. in Post 2 I told you how I got here. today in Post 3 I'm showing you how to build yours.

the scaffold prompt + MCP guide + security guide + 5 platform templates + AI slop checklist + a full video walkthrough of me building a repo from scratch. all in the newsletter.

link in the first comment.

here's what I want to be real about: this is not a "5-minute hack." I still learn something new about this system every day. the prompt gives you the foundation. mastery comes from living inside it.

but at least you won't be starting from a blank folder wondering where things go.

no gatekeeping ✌

## Comment Thread (for all versions)

**Comment 1**: [Substack link] -- the full scaffold prompt, MCP guide, security guide, video walkthrough, and platform templates are in OS.AI Labs Post 3. subscribe and it's yours.

**Comment 2 (value pin)**: the scaffold prompt asks 3 questions: your name/brand, your platforms, and your tool stack. then it builds the full directory structure, .gitignore, README, voice template, and content pipeline folders. customized to what you actually use. I also recorded a full walkthrough video of me running it from an empty folder -- link in the newsletter.

## Notes

- Choose one version to post. Save the other hooks for future posts.
- Version 1 has the strongest emotional hook (17 tabs, frozen laptop). probably the best performer.
- Version 2 positions it as contrarian (your infrastructure is wrong). good for reach.
- Version 3 is the most build-in-public (gave it all away) and references the 3-post arc. good for engagement.
- The comment thread should include the Substack link and a value pin comment.
- Post this on Monday (2026-02-17) to coincide with Post 3 dropping on Substack.
