## Post Body

the plays series is going to YouTube.

if you've been following the "gtm plays i use every day" posts here on LinkedIn -- the screen recordings, the Clay walkthroughs, the full prompts in the comments --

imagine that, but expanded.

15-minute deep dives instead of 60-second clips. full builds from blank table to working pipeline. mistakes included.

here's what's coming:

⚡ **play walkthroughs** -- the LinkedIn plays series, expanded with voiceover, full context, and the reasoning behind every step

🔧 **Cursor build sessions** -- live builds of the GTM and Content Operating Systems i just shared. you'll see how skill files, MCP servers, and AI orchestration actually work together

🧠 **tool deep dives** -- Clay, HubSpot, Instantly, Browserbase, Claude Code -- not product reviews. real workflows running in production for real clients

🧙‍♂️ **system architecture breakdowns** -- how to build your own operating system for GTM. the full structure, not just the highlights

this has been building for a while.

every screen recording i've posted here was practice. every plays post was a proof of concept. the LinkedIn content was the trailer. YouTube is the full movie.

the channel isn't live yet. but it's coming soon.

when it drops, you'll be the first to know.

follow along here and i'll share the link the moment it's ready.

## Comment Thread Content

**Comment 1:**
for real though -- the plays series has been the best thing i've done for building in public. 15 plays documented. real workflows. no gatekeeping.

but LinkedIn's format limits how deep i can go. a screen recording with a paragraph of context only tells part of the story.

YouTube lets me show the full build. the thinking. the debugging. the "wait why did Sculptor return that" moments.

**Comment 2:**
if there's a specific play or workflow you want to see expanded into a full video, drop it in the comments.

i'm building the first batch of content now and your requests are going straight into the queue.
