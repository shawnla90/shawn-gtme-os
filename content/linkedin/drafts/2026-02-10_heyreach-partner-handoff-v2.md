## Version 1: The v2 Evolution Hook

the gtm plays series just leveled up. part 16.

and no — i'm not dropping Clay. we're evolving.

this one runs on HeyReach's MCP. Cursor. LinkedIn recon. Slack. one workflow, chained.

here's the play:

✅ HeyReach MCP — pull accepted + unaccepted CSV from the campaign. two exports, one source of truth.

🔧 accepted list — run linkedin recon. deep research on every profile. recent posts, activity, personalization hooks. the caller gets context before the call, not a cold sheet.

➡️ unaccepted list — updated tab, current as of today. partner gets both. caller knows who to prioritize.

🧠 partner handoff — draft the message. attach the CSVs. ship. one skill orchestrates the whole thing.

the energy shift: more MCP, more Cursor, more the workflow versions itself. Clay still runs half my plays. 

but the stack is growing. and the plays are too.

## Version 2: The Pain Point Hook

your partner just asked for the latest accepted list. and the unaccepted. and who should get called first. and can you send it to Slack.

five tools. three CSVs. one handoff.

gtm plays i use every day, part 16 ⚡ — HeyReach partner handoff, v2.

the play: HeyReach MCP pulls everything. accepted gets deep research (linkedin recon → posts, activity, hooks). unaccepted gets the updated list. caller gets a recon report. Contax gets the message. Slack gets the files. one skill does the orchestration.

i didn't stop using Clay. i added MCP. the plays evolved. more Cursor, more chaining, more "the system runs itself."

this is what v2 looks like. not a replacement — an expansion.

## Version 3: The Results Angle

12 accepted. 123 unaccepted. partner needed both by 7:30.

one skill: heyreach-partner-handoff.

✅ HeyReach MCP → accepted + unaccepted CSV. no manual export, no copy-paste.

✅ linkedin recon on accepted → RECON-REPORT. caller sees recent posts, activity, who to call first.

✅ upload to Slack. draft Contax message. attach files. done.

gtm plays i use every day, part 16 ⚡ — and it's v2 energy.

more MCP. more Cursor. more workflows that chain skills instead of tools. Clay's still in the stack. we're just adding layers.

the play file is the source of truth. the workflow versions itself.

no gatekeeping — skill doc in comments.

## Comment Thread Content

**Comment 1:**
Full heyreach-partner-handoff skill lives at .cursor/skills/heyreach-partner-handoff/SKILL.md — chains heyreach-export (MCP), linkedin-recon (browser), upload_heyreach_to_slack.py. Partner path: clients/partner/<partner>/resources/. Contax message drafts to resources/contax-<contact>-YYYY-MM-DD.md.

**Comment 2:**
Play 16 is the first "v2" play in the series — MCP + Cursor orchestration, not Clay-heavy. The shift: workflows that version in a repo, skills that chain other skills. Clay stays. We're expanding the stack.

**Comment 3:**
If you're running HeyReach campaigns and hand off to partners (SDRs, AEs, callers) — this play gives them accepted with recon context and unaccepted with an updated list. No more "which CSV is current."

## Notes

**Never use partner names in posts** — use "partner" or "they." No client/contact names in LinkedIn or X.

Play 16 — HeyReach Partner Handoff (v2). Energy: more MCP, more Cursor, evolving from Clay-heavy. Not losing Clay. Key workflow: HeyReach MCP → accepted/unaccepted CSV → deep research on accepted (linkedin-recon) → route to caller → Contax handoff. Screenshot: HeyReach export output, Slack tab with two CSVs, or Cursor showing the skill + MCP tools.
