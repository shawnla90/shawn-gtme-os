## Version 1: The System Reveal

just built a slash command that drafts posts from skill files.

/skillplay — you give it a skill name or have one open, and it turns that skill into a LinkedIn post plus an X thread for the skills I use everyday series.

the difference from /playdraft: playdraft is screenshot-first. you show what you built, the screenshot proves it. skill-play is skill-first. the skill file IS the source. purpose, triggers, workflow — all of it becomes the post. screenshot optional.

why this matters: the tools that document your work should be documented too. and when the first thing you do with a new command is use it on itself, you know you built something that eats its own dog food.

run /skillplay voice-modularity or /skillplay play-draft or any skill in the tree. the file does the work. no screenshot required unless you want to show it in action.

## Version 2: The Meta Take

meta x3: a post about the command that creates posts about skills. written by running that command on itself. with a screenshot of the prompt as you type it.

that's skill-play in action. skills I use everyday, part 2 ⚡

the content operating system documents itself. you build a skill that turns skills into content. you use it for the first time on... itself. the screenshot captures the exact moment you're writing the prompt that generates the post. recursion done right.

why document your documentation tools? because the builders who level up fastest are the ones who treat their setup as content. GTM plays got screen recordings. skills get slash commands. same energy, different medium.

/skillplay — skill name or open file, and you get 3 LinkedIn versions plus 10 X tweets. the skill file is the context. no screenshot required. but when you've got one of you literally using it in the moment... that's the hook.

## Version 3: The Invitation

here's the framework: skill file → post draft. no screenshot gatekeeping. the skill's purpose, triggers, and workflow become the content.

skills I use everyday, part 2 ⚡ — and this one's the command that makes the rest of the series possible.

/skillplay <skill-name>. or /skillplay with a skill file open. the file is the source of truth. it resolves the skill, pulls voice and pillar refs, assigns a part number, and spits out LinkedIn drafts plus an X thread. 8 steps. documented in the skill itself. so meta the first run was on itself.

if you're building with Cursor and stacking skills, this pattern scales. document what you use. turn your setup into content. the structure matters more than the specific skills — make the framework yours.

## Comment Thread Content

**Lead comment (how it works):**
"the workflow: resolve skill → get series part number → extract context (triggers, what it does, why it matters) → load voice + pillar refs → generate 3 LinkedIn versions + 10 X tweets → update index. all from the skill file. the screenshot was bonus — proof that the first action was using it on itself."

**Follow-up (the meta reasoning):**
"you learn more from the recursion than from the output. when your documentation tool documents itself, you're forced to make it general enough to work on any skill. that constraint makes the system better."

**Customization hook:**
"if you grab this and want to make it yours: the version angles (system reveal, meta take, invitation) work for any skill share. swap the skill file, keep the structure."

## Notes

skill-play is the command that creates posts about skills. Part 2 because Voice Modularity (Part 1) was the series kickoff. This post captures the meta moment: first run, on itself, screenshot of the prompt in progress. The skill differentiates from play-draft (screenshot-first) by being skill-first — the file IS the source. Optional screenshot enhances but isn't required. Perfect for Building & Sharing / Skill System Shares pillar.
