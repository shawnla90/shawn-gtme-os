## Version 1: The System Reveal

i'm screen recording myself right now. talking to my IDE. and the play i'm showing is the content operating system — creating itself.

that's the meta angle. the system generates the post that documents the system.

here's how it actually works ⚡

🔧 cursor + claude code + a skill file called play-draft
🔗 i describe what i built, drop the pillar, hit enter
🧠 the skill loads voice DNA, pillar structure, formatting guides
➡️ it outputs 3 linkedin versions + 10 x tweets + comment thread content

all from "i built this, here's the screenshot, go."

no jumping between notion and docs. no "let me write this later." the build is the draft. the draft is the build.

if you're building in public but content creation feels like a separate job from the thing you're building — that's the gap this closes. your output becomes your content. the receipts are the post.

## Version 2: The Meta Take

the most meta thing i've done this week: used my content OS to write a post about my content OS.

screen recording. me talking to the IDE. the skill running live. and the output you're reading? generated by the same system it's describing.

why build it this way?

because the alternative is broken. you ship something cool. then you sit down to "write a post about it." different context. different tool. different energy. the moment's gone.

the content OS flips it. the build IS the content creation context. cursor's open. claude's running. you say "playdraft — here's what i built, here's the pillar." and you get linkedin + x drafts before you've closed the tab.

dogfooding at the idea level. the system documents itself because it's already running when you need the documentation.

## Version 3: The Invitation

i'm recording my screen right now. speaking into the IDE. and the post you're reading was generated by the play i'm recording.

content engineering. live.

the skill file knows my voice. knows the pillar structure. knows linkedin vs x formatting. when i run /playdraft with a screenshot and context, it produces 3 linkedin versions and a 10-tweet story arc. the comment thread content. the sign-offs. the whole package.

you don't need to build this exact thing. but the pattern is worth stealing: **your build environment should be your content environment.** no handoff. no "i'll write about it later." the moment you ship is the moment you draft.

if you're building systems for GTM, for content, for anything — the meta play is making the system document itself. not as an afterthought. as part of the loop.

## Comment Thread Content

**Comment 1:**
the play-draft skill is in the repo. it reads a screenshot, loads pillar guides (plays series, building & sharing, skill/system shares), pulls voice DNA, and outputs markdown files to content/linkedin/drafts and content/x/drafts. the structure is all in the skill — the human provides context + pillar. that's it.

**Comment 2:**
no gatekeeping — the repo structure, skill files, and play index are all documented. if you want to adapt this for your own content system, start with the /playdraft flow. screenshot → context → pillar → drafts. the rest scales from there.

**Comment 3:**
building in public is only sustainable if content creation isn't a separate job. this is how i made it one job. if you're doing something similar, dm me. i want to see it.

## Notes

Meta scenario: screen recording of running /playdraft live. The content OS creating a post about the content OS. Pillar: Skill/System Shares — sharing the system, the dogfooding angle, the "build environment = content environment" pattern. Key themes: recursive documentation, no handoff, IDE as content creation context, dogfooding.
