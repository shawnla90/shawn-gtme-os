## Hook Options (5 alternatives for first line)

1. I built two operating systems inside one repo. then I made them draw themselves.
2. this is what happens when your content OS and GTM OS live in the same repo — and you finally visualize it.
3. watching your own system evolve is one of the dopest parts of building in public.
4. two operating systems. one repo. one schematic. and I'm honestly hyped about it.
5. I didn't plan to build two operating systems. but here we are — and they just visualized themselves.

## Version 1: The Meta Take

I built two operating systems inside one repo. then I made them draw themselves.

not gonna lie — this is one of the coolest things I've shipped so far.

I have a content OS and a GTM OS. they live in the same git repo. they work together. but they're two completely different systems with two different jobs.

the GTM OS runs outbound — Clay tables, HeyReach campaigns, Instantly sequences, partner handoffs, CRM syncs. pipeline infrastructure.

the content OS runs everything you're reading right now — voice files, platform playbooks, draft workflows, 23 Cursor skills, 10 content pillars, publishing pipelines across 6 platforms.

same repo. same Cursor workspace. two operating systems working side by side.

and today I generated a schematic of the content side:

⚡ 10 content pillars
⚡ 6 platforms
⚡ 16 GTM plays documented
⚡ 23 active skills
⚡ IDEA → DRAFT → FINAL → PUBLISH → REPURPOSE

one Python script. one render. the repo drew a picture of itself.

no Figma. no manual layout. the file tree IS the data source.

but here's what gets me hyped — watching this thing evolve in real time. two weeks ago the content OS had maybe 5 skills and 2 pillars. now it's 23 skills, 10 pillars, TikTok pipeline queued, Substack defined, YouTube and Reddit on deck.

it grows every single day. and seeing that growth visualized? that hits different.

you build a repo. you manage a repo. but when you can actually see it — the whole system mapped out in one frame — that's when it stops being files and folders and starts being something real.

I'm genuinely stoked about this. still building. still iterating. and it's only getting bigger.

## Version 2: The Builder Angle

this is what happens when your content OS and GTM OS live in the same repo — and you finally visualize it.

I'm not gonna pretend this isn't cool. because it is.

I've been building two operating systems inside one git repo. the GTM OS handles the pipeline — Clay enrichment, HeyReach outreach, Instantly campaigns, partner handoffs, CRM syncs. the content OS handles everything you see here — voice DNA, platform playbooks, draft workflows, skills, publishing pipelines.

two systems. same repo. different identities. working together.

the GTM OS feeds the content OS real stories. the content OS documents what the GTM OS builds. they're symbiotic but they're not the same thing.

today I generated a schematic of the content side and it honestly surprised me:

⚡ 10 content pillars defined
⚡ 6 platforms active
⚡ 16 GTM plays documented
⚡ 23 Cursor skills running
⚡ 18 LinkedIn drafts in various stages
⚡ TikTok pipeline with 6 series queued
⚡ Substack, YouTube, Reddit — defined and ready

and this is just the content half.

one Python script read the file tree and rendered the whole thing. no Figma, no design tool — the repo visualized itself.

watching this evolve has been one of the most satisfying parts of building in public. every day the system gets a little bigger. a new skill file. a new pillar. a new platform integration. and now I can actually see it happening — not just feel it in the file tree.

you build systems. you ship from systems. but when you step back and visualize the growth? that's when you realize what you actually have.

and I'm just getting started.

## Version 3: The Growth Story

watching your own system evolve is one of the dopest parts of building in public.

last week my content OS was a handful of skill files and two content pillars inside my own head. today it's this:

⚡ 10 content pillars
⚡ 6 platforms
⚡ 16 GTM plays documented
⚡ 23 active Cursor skills
⚡ full pipeline: IDEA → DRAFT → FINAL → PUBLISH → REPURPOSE
⚡ TikTok series queued. Substack defined. YouTube and Reddit on deck.

and that's just the content OS.

I actually built two operating systems inside the same repo.

the GTM OS runs outbound infrastructure. Clay tables, HeyReach campaigns, Instantly sequences, partner exports, CRM syncs. that's the engine that builds pipeline.

the content OS runs the entire content machine. voice DNA, platform playbooks, draft workflows, publishing automations. that's the engine that builds audience.

two systems. one repo. separate identities. working together every single day.

the GTM OS generates the stories. the content OS tells them.

the GTM OS ships the plays. the content OS documents them.

they feed each other. and they're both growing — fast.

today I generated a schematic and got to see the content side mapped out in one frame. Python script, Pillow, the actual file tree as the data source. one render. one screenshot.

and honestly? I'm fired up about it. seeing what started as a messy folder of markdown files turn into a real system with real structure — that never gets old.

this is what building in public looks like when you stop talking about it and start versioning it.

still early. still growing. and tomorrow the schematic will already be outdated — because something new gets added every day.

PS. to clarify the dual-OS setup: the GTM OS and content OS share the same git repo but have completely separate directory trees. GTM side has client folders, partner resources, campaign exports, CRM sync scripts. content side has skills, voice tiers, platform playbooks, draft pipelines. they coexist because the work feeds each other — but they're distinct systems. if there's interest I'll break down the repo structure. no gatekeeping ✌

PPS. the schematic was generated with a Python script that reads the actual file tree — skill files, draft counts, platform directories, voice tiers — and renders it with Pillow. no Figma, no manual layout. the repo IS the data source. one-shot render, no iteration needed. that's the part that gets me — the system is structured enough that it can describe itself.

## Notes

- Image: screenshots/content-os-schematic.png (dark-themed schematic showing full content OS)
- Key stats from image: 10 pillars, 6 platforms, 16 GTM plays, 23 skills, 10 LI drafts, 8 LI finals, 10 X drafts, 5 X finals
- Pillar: Building & Sharing — narrative, reflective, personal journey angle
- Key angle: TWO operating systems (content OS + GTM OS) living in the same repo with separate identities
- GTM OS = pipeline infrastructure (Clay, HeyReach, Instantly, CRM, partner handoffs)
- Content OS = content machine (voice, playbooks, skills, drafts, publishing)
- They feed each other: GTM generates stories, Content tells them
- Tone: hyped, excited, genuine builder energy about watching the system grow
- The schematic is the content OS side only — the GTM OS gets its own visualization eventually
