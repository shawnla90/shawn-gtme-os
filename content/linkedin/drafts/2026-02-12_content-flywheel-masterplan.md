## Hook Options (5 alternatives for first line)

1. most people run their content from 14 browser tabs and a prayer. I run mine from a git repo.
2. my content system writes to 6 platforms in my voice without a single copy-paste.
3. 26 skills. 10 pillars. 6 platforms. 1 repo. 0 chatbot chains.
4. there's a version of content creation that doesn't involve matching ChatGPT windows for 3 hours.
5. I built a content operating system inside a code editor. here's the master plan.

## Version 1: The Flywheel Reveal

most people run their content from 14 browser tabs and a prayer. I run mine from a git repo.

not metaphorically. literally a git repo with 26 Cursor skills, 10 content pillars, and publishing pipelines to 6 platforms. LinkedIn. X. Substack. Reddit. TikTok. YouTube. all from one hub.

here's how it works (diagram attached):

⚡ at the center sits the repo. one codebase. two operating systems living side by side — a GTM OS that runs pipeline infrastructure and a content OS that runs the entire content machine.

🧠 wrapped around the core is the voice DNA layer. four files — core-voice.md, viral-hooks.md, anti-slop.md, safety-filters.md — that teach every skill how I write, what I sound like, and what patterns to avoid. my voice isn't a vibe. it's versioned.

🔧 the skills engine is the layer that does the work. 26 active skills that transform inputs into outputs. screenshot to LinkedIn post. draft to publish-ready plain text. topic to X micro-tip. image to 10-post story arc. Substack draft to cross-platform promo snippets.

📡 the outer ring is the platform distribution. each platform has its own playbook — tone, format, character limits, CTA style — and the skills know which playbook to reference. same voice, different compression.

and the flywheel part? the GTM OS generates the stories. the content OS documents them. the content OS ships the plays. the GTM OS runs the pipeline those plays describe. they feed each other.

36 active drafts in pipeline right now. all tracked automatically by a daily scanner that reads git commits, detects new files, and renders a dashboard card.

this isn't a content calendar. it's infrastructure.

no chatbot chains. no browser bluffs. no copy-pasting between tabs and hoping the tone matches. one system. one voice. multi-threaded output.

the full architecture diagram breaks down every skill, every platform, every voice tier. attached.

## Version 2: The Anti-Chatbot Take

there's a version of content creation that doesn't involve matching ChatGPT windows for 3 hours.

no teased screenshots. no browser bluffs. no pasting the same brief into 4 different chat threads and hoping the voice stays consistent. no "generate me a LinkedIn post about X" copy-paste loop that produces slop.

I built the other version.

it's a content operating system that lives inside a git repo. same repo that runs my GTM pipeline infrastructure. two operating systems, one codebase.

the content side has:

⚡ 26 Cursor skills — each one a specialized workflow. /playdraft turns a screenshot into LinkedIn + X drafts. /finalcopy converts a markdown draft to publish-ready plain text. /substackpost generates newsletter content with automatic post numbering. /xtip produces micro-tip posts. /tiktokscript writes short-form video scripts.

🧠 3 voice tiers — core voice DNA, platform-specific playbooks, and content ops rules. every skill inherits from the same voice files. that means my LinkedIn posts, X threads, Substack essays, and Reddit posts all sound like me. not like ChatGPT doing a Shawn impression.

📡 6 platform outputs — LinkedIn, X, Substack, Reddit, TikTok, YouTube. each platform has its own formatting rules, CTA patterns, and hook styles. the skills know the difference.

10 content pillars structure the topics. a daily tracker auto-detects what I shipped. the whole thing versions itself through git.

right now there are 36 active drafts in the pipeline across all platforms. all generated from the same hub. all in my voice.

the master plan diagram attached shows the full architecture — voice tiers, skills engine, platform distribution, everything.

this is what happens when you stop treating content as a task and start treating it as a system.

## Version 3: The Numbers Proof

26 skills. 10 pillars. 6 platforms. 36 active drafts. 1 repo.

that's what the content operating system looks like today (diagram attached).

I don't write content in browser tabs. I don't maintain a Notion board. I don't paste prompts into ChatGPT and hope the formatting works.

I run slash commands inside a code editor.

/playdraft → screenshot becomes LinkedIn + X drafts
/finalcopy → draft becomes publish-ready plain text
/substackpost → topic becomes newsletter post #N
/xtip → one-liner becomes micro-tip thread
/tiktokscript → concept becomes 16-second storyboard
/imagecontent → image becomes 3 LinkedIn versions + 10-post X arc

every one of those skills inherits from the same voice DNA files. core-voice.md defines how I write. viral-hooks.md sharpens the openers. anti-slop.md catches AI patterns before they ship. platform playbooks handle the formatting per channel.

what you get is multi-threaded content output that all sounds like youe.

this should be loaded in as. a comment thread 
today's pipeline:
⚡ LinkedIn: 11+ drafts queued
⚡ X: 12+ drafts queued
📰 Substack: 4 posts in pipeline
🗣️ Reddit: 2 posts ready
🎬 TikTok: scripts queued
📺 YouTube: platform defined

and the daily tracker caught all of it automatically. git commits, new files, content directory scans — merged into a JSON log and rendered as a dashboard card.

two operating systems in one repo. GTM OS for pipeline. content OS for distribution. they feed each other.

the architecture diagram shows the full master plan. every skill, every tier, every platform.

## Comment Thread Content

**Comment 1:**
the voice layer is the part that changed everything. before I built the voice DNA files, every AI-generated draft sounded generic. now every skill reads the same 4 core files before it writes anything. the output sounds like me because it literally learned from my patterns, not a generic writing prompt.

here's what lives in the voice DNA:
→ core-voice.md (identity, tone, sentence patterns)
→ viral-hooks.md (scroll-stopping openers)
→ anti-slop.md (29 AI patterns to catch and fix)
→ safety-filters.md (client/partner name protection)

**Comment 2:**
the flywheel isn't theoretical. the GTM OS runs campaigns — Clay enrichment, HeyReach outreach, Instantly email sequences, partner handoffs. every one of those generates a story. the content OS documents those stories as plays, skill shares, build logs. those posts build audience. that audience feeds the GTM pipeline. loop.

**Comment 3:**
full skill list for the curious:
play-draft, final-copy, substack-post, final-substack, x-tip, tiktok-script, viral-hooks, image-to-content, content-images, daily-tracker, skill-play, value-pin-comments, linkedin-comments, agent-context-handoff, heyreach-export, heyreach-handoff, heyreach-conversations, linkedin-recon, slack-sync, slack-mcp, slack-reminder, email-copy, instantly-replies, notion-sync, repo-stats, add-mcp

26 active. more queued. no gatekeeping. ask me about any of them.

## Notes

- Image: content-os-masterplan.png (hub-and-spoke radial diagram generated with Pillow)
- Also attach daily tracker screenshot (data/daily-log/2026-02-11.png) as second image or in comments
- This is a Building & Sharing post with Skill/System Shares overlap
- Angle: hype the content OS architecture while showing it's a real, running system
- Anti-chatbot positioning: contrast with copy-paste AI workflows
- The GTM OS + Content OS flywheel is the key narrative
- Consider posting with both the masterplan diagram and the tracker screenshot for proof
