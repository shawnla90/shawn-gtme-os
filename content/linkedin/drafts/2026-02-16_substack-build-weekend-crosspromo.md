the OS.AI Labs newsletter just dropped a new post.

the full build weekend story. how one website became three. the Turborepo architecture. what's actually live on shawnos.ai right now and why none of it is gated.

if you've been following the build-in-public journey here, this is the deep cut. the stuff that doesn't fit in a LinkedIn post.

subscribe link is in the comments. free, no catch, no pitch deck at the end.

three posts live so far. the system, the identity shift, and now the build weekend. the Cursor discovery story drops this week.
