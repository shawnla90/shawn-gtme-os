# LinkedIn About Me - Alternative Version

Plumber → SDR → GTM Engineer.

Used to be known as the "Clay guy." Learned something important: you're not defined by your tools. You're defined by what you build and the problems you solve.

I work with AI as a collaborator, not a replacement. Building GTM systems that actually scale. Shipping code daily.

The work speaks for itself.
