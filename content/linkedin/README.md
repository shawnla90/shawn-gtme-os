# LinkedIn Content Queue

Content drafts for LinkedIn posts. Each file is a standalone post ready to copy-paste into LinkedIn.

## File Naming

```
YYYY-MM-DD_slug.md
```

Example: `2026-02-09_youtube-hype.md`

## Workflow

1. Draft goes in `drafts/`
2. Run through pre-publish checklist (`skills/tier-3-content-ops/pre-publish-checklist.md`)
3. Copy-paste into LinkedIn
4. Move to `published/` after posting (or delete -- git history has it)

## Format

Each draft file contains:
- **Frontmatter**: pillar, status, date
- **Post body**: ready to paste
- **Comment thread content**: separated section for comments delivery (prompts, formulas, resources)
- **Image notes**: references to any attached images

## Voice Reference

See `skills/tier-2-context-playbooks/linkedin.md` for LinkedIn-specific voice and formatting rules.
