## Hook (0-3 seconds)

**On-screen text**: "your AI sounds like AI. fix it."

**Voiceover**:
> your AI content sounds like AI because you keep your voice in your head instead of in a file.

**Expression**: confident

**Visual**: Dark terminal bg with faint green text scrolling. Character fades in lower-right.

## Body (3-18 seconds)

**Voiceover**:
> I have a markdown file called core-voice.md.
> every rule about how I write lives there. lowercase style. no em-dashes. no authority phrases.
> when I generate content, the AI reads that file first.
> saw something I didn't like in a draft? I edit the file. next draft already has the fix.

**Expression sequence**:
1. explaining — "I have a markdown file called core-voice.md."
2. explaining — "every rule about how I write lives there."
3. reacting — "when I generate content, the AI reads that file first."
4. confident — "saw something I didn't like? edit the file. next draft already has it."

**Screen recording / B-roll**:
- Show Cursor IDE with core-voice.md open (quick flash, 2 seconds)
- Show a draft being generated with skill file loaded
- Show editing a rule in the voice file (zoomed on the edit)
- Show the next draft output reflecting the change

**On-screen text overlays**:
- "core-voice.md"
- "edit the file"
- "next draft has the fix"

## Closer (18-22 seconds)

**Voiceover**:
> your voice rules shouldn't live in a prompt. they should live in a file you can version.

**Expression**: confident

**On-screen text**: "voice rules → file → version control"

**Visual loop**: End on the terminal bg with green text — matches the opening frame.

## ElevenLabs Text Block

```text
your AI content sounds like AI because you keep your voice in your head instead of in a file.

I have a markdown file called core-voice.md. every rule about how I write lives there. lowercase style. no em-dashes. no authority phrases.

when I generate content, the AI reads that file first. saw something I didn't like in a draft? I edit the file. next draft already has the fix.

your voice rules shouldn't live in a prompt. they should live in a file you can version.
```

## Notes

Repurposed from the Voice Modularity LinkedIn post (Skills I Use Everyday Part 1). The core insight — voice rules in editable files instead of prompts — is the single most visual moment. The meta loop (editing the system while using the system) is the hook. Strong for the "How to Not Sound Like AI" series because it directly addresses the #1 complaint about AI content.
