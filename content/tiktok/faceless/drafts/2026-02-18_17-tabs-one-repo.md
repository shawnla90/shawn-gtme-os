## Hook (0-3 seconds)

**On-screen text**: "17 tabs open. laptop frozen."

**Voiceover**:
> seventeen tabs. laptop frozen. Instantly. HubSpot. Clay. Slack. Sheets. LinkedIn. Notion. all open.

**Expression**: reacting

**Visual**: Screenshot or animation of a browser with 17+ tabs crammed across the top. Character reacts to it.

## Body (3-18 seconds)

**Voiceover**:
> the problem was never the tools. every tool worked fine alone. the problem was the switching.
> so I put everything into one repo. version controlled. the AI talks to the CRM. the content system talks to the outreach stack. no tabs. no copy-pasting between apps.
> one folder tree. that's the whole operating system.

**Expression sequence**:
1. explaining — "the problem was never the tools. the problem was the switching."
2. explaining — "so I put everything into one repo. version controlled."
3. confident — "one folder tree. that's the whole operating system."

**Screen recording / B-roll**:
- Flash the 17-tab browser (2 seconds, relatable)
- Show the repo folder tree in Cursor sidebar (clean, organized)
- Show MCP servers connected (Slack, GitHub icons in Cursor)
- Show a command running that pulls data from multiple tools without leaving the editor

**On-screen text overlays**:
- "17 tabs"
- "one repo"
- "no copy-paste"

## Closer (18-24 seconds)

**Voiceover**:
> tabs are not infrastructure. your repo is.

**Expression**: confident

**On-screen text**: "follow for the full scaffold."

**Visual loop**: Repo folder tree fades to dark bg — matches the opening dark screen.

the problem was never the tools. every tool worked fine alone. the problem was the switching.

so I put everything into one repo. version controlled. the AI talks to the CRM. the content system talks to the outreach stack. no tabs. no copy-pasting between apps.

one folder tree. that's the whole operating system.

tabs are not infrastructure. your repo is.

## Notes

Repurposed from the Build Your Own OS X thread (Post 4 cross-promo). The "17 tabs frozen" moment is universally relatable — everyone has been there. The contrast (chaos → clean repo) is visually strong. Great series opener for "Terminal Alchemist Tips" because it introduces the character's philosophy: everything should live in one place, version controlled, AI-connected. The closing line ("tabs are not infrastructure") is a quotable pattern recognition moment.
