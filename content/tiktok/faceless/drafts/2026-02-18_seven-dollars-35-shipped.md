**Voiceover**:
> I built a skill inside Cursor that scans my git history, content folders, and token logs every night.
> it scores everything I shipped. drafts, skills, workflows. each one gets points.
> then it renders a dashboard. dark mode. terminal aesthetic. letter grade and all.
> yesterday? A+. 148 points. 3.1 million tokens. 19 points per dollar.

**Expression sequence**:
1. explaining — "I built a skill inside Cursor that scans my git history..."
2. explaining — "it scores everything I shipped."
3. reacting — "then it renders a dashboard. dark mode. terminal aesthetic."
4. confident — "yesterday? A+. 148 points. 19 points per dollar."

## ElevenLabs Text Block

```text
seven dollars and seventy five cents on AI yesterday. shipped 35 things. and I have the receipt.

I built a skill inside Cursor that scans my git history, content folders, and token logs every night. it scores everything I shipped. drafts, skills, workflows. each one gets points.

then it renders a dashboard. dark mode. terminal aesthetic. letter grade and all.

yesterday? A plus. 148 points. 3.1 million tokens. 19 points per dollar.

if you're building with AI every day and you don't know your token economics, you're flying blind.

## Production Notes

**Screen recording needed**: Yes — running /tracker in Cursor, the dashboard rendering
**B-roll alternative**: Use the actual daily tracker PNG as the primary visual behind the character
**Audio**: ElevenLabs TTS → Terminal Alchemist voice
**Lip sync**: SadTalker / D-ID (neutral expression as base)
**Compositing**: Character lower-right, dashboard as main content — character smaller for this one since the dashboard IS the content
**Cross-post to**: Reels, Shorts, LinkedIn video

## Notes

Repurposed from the Daily Tracker Build LinkedIn post. The data is the hook — $7.75 for 35 shipped items is a concrete, surprising number. The dashboard visual gives this video a strong B-roll asset that most faceless accounts don't have (actual tool output, not generic footage). Strong for "Skills That Run My Business" series because it showcases a real daily-use skill from the repo.
