## Hook (0-3 seconds)

**On-screen text**: "draft to published. one command. 3 seconds."

**Voiceover**:
> one slash command. markdown draft to copy-paste ready post. three seconds.

**Expression**: confident

**Visual**: Cursor IDE open with a markdown draft file visible. Character in lower-right.

## Body (3-14 seconds)

**Voiceover**:
> I write everything in markdown. every draft, every post, every newsletter.
> when it's ready, I type /finalcopy. the system strips formatting, normalizes the voice, and saves a clean .txt file.
> paste into LinkedIn. paste into Typefully. done.

**Expression sequence**:
1. explaining — "I write everything in markdown."
2. reacting — "when it's ready, I type /finalcopy."
3. confident — "paste into LinkedIn. paste into Typefully. done."

**Screen recording / B-roll**:
- Show a markdown draft in Cursor (zoomed, readable)
- Show typing /finalcopy in the agent chat
- Show the output appearing as clean plain text
- Quick flash of pasting into a text field

**On-screen text overlays**:
- "/finalcopy"
- "strips formatting"
- "paste and post"

## Closer (14-18 seconds)

> no more reformatting. no more copy-edit passes. the command does it.

**Expression**: confident

## Notes

From the tiktok-index queued topic list. /finalcopy is one of the most visually demonstrable skills — the input/output transformation is instantly clear on screen. Perfect series opener for "Claude Code Secrets" because it shows a real daily-use command with a visible before/after. Short runtime (18 seconds) makes this high-completion-rate material.
