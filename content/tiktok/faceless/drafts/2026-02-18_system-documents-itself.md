## Hook (0-3 seconds)

**On-screen text**: "I'm recording myself making this post."

**Voiceover**:
> I'm screen recording myself creating this post. the play I'm showing IS the system that creates the post.

**Expression**: reacting

**Visual**: Screen recording of Cursor IDE with the agent chat open and a draft being generated. Meta inception moment.

## Body (3-16 seconds)

**Voiceover**:
> ship something. take a screenshot. type /playdraft with the context.
> the system outputs LinkedIn and X drafts before you close the tab.
> no switching apps. no "I'll write about it later." the build IS the content context.

**Expression sequence**:
1. explaining — "ship something. take a screenshot. type /playdraft."
2. reacting — "the system outputs LinkedIn and X drafts before you close the tab."
3. confident — "the build IS the content context."

**Screen recording / B-roll**:
- Show Cursor agent chat with /playdraft being typed
- Show drafts appearing in the output (markdown rendering)
- Show the file being saved to content/linkedin/drafts/
- Quick flash of the final post text

**On-screen text overlays**:
- "/playdraft"
- "drafts before you close the tab"
- "build = content"

## Closer (16-20 seconds)

**Voiceover**:
> the old way? ship something cool, say you'll write about it later. never do. this fixes that.

**Expression**: thinking

**On-screen text**: "save this. the system documents itself."

**Visual loop**: Cursor IDE view with the generated draft — matches the opening screen recording frame.

ship something. take a screenshot. type slash playdraft with the context. the system outputs LinkedIn and X drafts before you close the tab.

no switching apps. no I'll write about it later. the build IS the content context.

the old way? ship something cool, say you'll write about it later. never do. this fixes that.

## Production Notes

**Screen recording needed**: Yes — this one IS a screen recording by nature. Show Cursor, /playdraft running, drafts appearing.
**B-roll alternative**: None needed — the screen recording is the content
**Audio**: ElevenLabs TTS → Terminal Alchemist voice
**Lip sync**: SadTalker / D-ID (neutral expression as base)
**Compositing**: Character lower-right, screen recording as main content. Character can be smaller since the screen recording carries the video.
**Cross-post to**: Reels, Shorts, LinkedIn video

## Notes

Repurposed from the Content OS Meta X thread. The meta angle ("using the system to document the system") is the strongest hook in the repo — it's inherently interesting and creates a "wait, what?" moment. The visual proof is built-in: the screen recording of the system running IS the demo. This is the kind of video that drives saves and shares because people want to study how it works. Strong "Cursor Tricks You Missed" opener because /playdraft is a Cursor skill most people don't know exists.
