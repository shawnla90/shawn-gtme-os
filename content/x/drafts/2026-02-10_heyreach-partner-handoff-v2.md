## Tweet 1 (Hook)

the gtm plays just went v2. part 16. HeyReach MCP → accepted/unaccepted → deep research → caller routing. more MCP, more Cursor. not losing Clay. evolving. 🧙‍♂️

---

## Tweet 2 (The Connection)

your partner asks for accepted + unaccepted. who to call first. send to Slack. five tools, three CSVs, one handoff. used to be manual. now it's one skill.

---

## Tweet 3 (The Pattern)

HeyReach MCP pulls everything. accepted gets linkedin recon — posts, activity, hooks. caller gets context. unaccepted gets the updated list — fresh export, current as of today.

---

## Tweet 4 (The Build)

chained: heyreach-export (MCP) → linkedin-recon (accepted) → upload to Slack → draft Contax message. one skill orchestrates. the workflow versions in the repo.

---

## Tweet 5 (The Results)

12 accepted with recon. 123 unaccepted with current list. partner gets both. caller knows who to prioritize. no "which CSV is current" — there's a master list.

---

## Tweet 6 (The Insight)

Clay still runs half my plays. we're not replacing. we're expanding. MCP + Cursor = workflows that chain skills. the stack grew. the plays did too.

---

## Tweet 7 (The v2 Take)

this is what v2 looks like. more MCP, more Cursor, more "the system runs itself." Clay's in the stack. HeyReach MCP's in the stack. they work together.

---

## Tweet 8 (The Non-Clay Reality)

if you thought every play was Clay + HubSpot... play 16 says otherwise. LinkedIn campaigns, HeyReach, partner handoff. MCP does the pull. Cursor does the orchestration.

---

## Tweet 9 (The Difference)

before: manual export, copy-paste, "which list is current." after: one skill, two CSVs, recon report for the caller. the workflow versions. you ship.

---

## Tweet 10 (CTA)

gtm plays i use every day, part 16 ⚡ v2 energy. full workflow in the skill file. no gatekeeping. follow for more plays. shawn ⚡ the gtme alchemist 🧙‍♂️

## Notes

**Never use partner names in posts** — use "partner" or "they." No client/contact names in LinkedIn or X.

Play 16 — HeyReach Partner Handoff (v2). Energy: more MCP, more Cursor, evolving from Clay-heavy. Thread structure: hook → connection → pattern → build → results → insight → v2 take → non-Clay angle → difference → CTA.
