## Tweet 1 (Hook)

this weekend i built two operating systems inside Cursor.

1. a Go-To-Market OS
2. a Content OS

both version-controlled. 
both AI-native. 
both running in production right now.

here is the architecture: 👇

## Tweet 2 (The GTM OS)

the Go-To-Market Operating System:

⚡ client management (ICPs, personas, prompts per client)
⚡ 15+ plays running daily in Clay + HubSpot
⚡ MCP automations: fetching replies, LinkedIn recon, HeyReach exports
⚡ Slack for real-time alerts

all in a git repo. all portable.

## Tweet 3 (The Content OS)

the Content Operating System:

🧙‍♂️ tier 1: voice DNA (core voice, anti-slop filters)
🧙‍♂️ tier 2: platform playbooks (LinkedIn, X, YouTube)
🧙‍♂️ tier 3: content ops (pillars, checklists, capture)

every post runs through skill files that know my voice better than i do.

## Tweet 4 (The Cursor Angle)

the wild part about building this in Cursor:

the AI reads my skill files *before* generating anything.

it knows my voice. 
it knows my anti-patterns. 
it knows which client i'm working on.

it's not "AI writing content." 
it's AI operating my system.

## Tweet 5 (CTA)

this is just the start.

next up: 
- YouTube walkthroughs of the plays
- Live Cursor build sessions
- Open sourcing the system

building in public = sharing the mess and the wins.
