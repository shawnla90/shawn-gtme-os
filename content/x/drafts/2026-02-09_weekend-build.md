## Tweet 1 (Hook)

haven't posted here in a while.

been building.

this weekend i built two operating systems inside Cursor.

a Go-To-Market OS and a Content OS.

both version-controlled. both AI-native. both running in production right now.

## Tweet 2 (The GTM OS)

the Go-To-Market Operating System:

⚡ client management system (ICP, personas, prompts, workflows -- per client)
⚡ 15 documented plays running daily in Clay + HubSpot
⚡ MCP automations: Instantly reply fetching, LinkedIn recon, HeyReach exports
⚡ Slack integration for real-time campaign alerts

all in a git repo. all versioned. all portable.

## Tweet 3 (The Content OS)

the Content Operating System:

🧙‍♂️ tier 1: voice DNA (core voice, anti-slop detection, safety filters)
🧙‍♂️ tier 2: platform playbooks (LinkedIn, X, YouTube)
🧙‍♂️ tier 3: content ops (5 content pillars, pre-publish checklists, capture system)

every post i write now runs through skill files that know my voice better than i do.

---

## Tweet 4 (The Cursor Angle)

here's what's wild about building this inside Cursor:

the AI reads my skill files before generating anything.

it knows my voice. it knows my anti-patterns. it knows which client i'm working on.

it's not "AI writing my content." it's AI operating inside my system.

## Tweet 5 (What's Next)

this is the start. not the finish.

next: YouTube walkthroughs of the plays series. Cursor build sessions. the full system shared publicly.

building in public means you see the mess and the wins.

follow along if you're building GTM systems too ⚡
