## Tweet 1 (Hook + Image)

when I say "building cool stuff with Cursor and Claude Code" — I mean it literally.

Friday. one repo. the screen says the rest.

## Tweet 2 (Breadcrumb)

if you look closely there's more than one site on that screen.

none of them existed last week.

---

## Tweet 3 (Forward Tease)

hardware arrives next week. full reveal coming.

more to build. more to share.

---

## Tweet 4 (Optional — only if it feels right)

the daily tracker gave it an A+. 69 things shipped today. $15 in compute.

building in public means the receipts are in the screenshot.

## Internal Notes

- 3 tweets is the sweet spot. Tweet 4 is optional — only add if the thread needs one more beat.
- Tweet 1 carries the screenshot. the image does the talking.
- Tweet 2 is the Easter egg nudge for anyone who zooms in.
- Tweet 3 seeds Mac Mini / Neobots without naming them.
- Tweet 4 pulls a specific number from the tracker for credibility flex.
- This is a teaser, not a reveal. short. breadcrumbs only.
