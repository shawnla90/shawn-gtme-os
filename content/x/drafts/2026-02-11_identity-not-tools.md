## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)

I was the Clay guy.

posted about Clay every day. built live on Clay. the label stuck.

then I realized my entire identity was sitting on someone else's foundation.

one acquisition away from rebuilding everything. 🧵

### Tweet 2 (The Problem)

when your identity is tied to a tool, you start filtering every idea through that tool.

you see everything as a Clay problem. an Instantly problem. a Cursor problem.

and you miss the patterns that work across all of them.

I was building ceilings and calling them floors.

### Tweet 3 (The Shift)

two weeks ago I didn't know what a git repo was. not really.

my entire system lived in my head, in scattered Notion docs, and in Slack messages I'd never find again.

then I started pulling it out. file by file. and everything changed.

---

### Tweet 4 (The Insight)

your most valuable IP isn't your tool proficiency.

it's the system in your head that you've never written down.

the moment I started extracting it into a repo, three things happened:

I could see it.
I could improve it.
I realized the tools were just plugins.

---

### Tweet 5 (CTA + Link)

wrote the full identity awakening story in today's OS.AI Labs post.

not a tutorial. not a how-to. the moment I stopped being the tool guy and started being the system guy.

Friday: the discovery that changed everything.
Monday: the scaffold prompt so you can build yours.

## Notes

- Thread is tight at 5 tweets. each stands alone.
- Tweet 1 is the hook. the Clay reference and "someone else's foundation" creates immediate tension.
- Tweet 4 is the most quotable/retweetable. the three-thing structure is clean.
- Tweet 5 teases the arc (today → Friday → Monday) which gives people a reason to subscribe, not just read.
- The thread drives to Substack without being salesy. the value is in the thread itself. the Substack link is for people who want more.
