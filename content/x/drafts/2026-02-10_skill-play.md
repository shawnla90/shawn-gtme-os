## Tweet 1 — Hook

meta x3: a post about the command that creates posts about skills. written by running that command on itself. screenshot is the prompt as you type it.

skills I use everyday, part 2 ⚡

---

## Tweet 2 — Context

/skillplay — the slash command that turns Cursor skills into LinkedIn and X content.

skill file in. drafts out. no screenshot required.

---

## Tweet 3 — Problem

playdraft needs a screenshot. you show what you built. the image is proof.

but skills? they live in .md files. purpose, triggers, workflow. all documented. why gate content behind a screenshot when the file has everything?

---

## Tweet 4 — Build

built skill-play to read the skill file as context. resolves the skill → pulls voice + pillar refs → assigns part number → generates 3 LinkedIn versions + 10 X tweets.

8 steps. the skill documents the skill.

---

## Tweet 5 — Results

first run: /skillplay on skill-play itself.

the post you're reading was drafted by the command it's about. recursion. the screenshot? the prompt being typed in real time.

---

## Tweet 6 — Insight

when your documentation tool documents itself, you're forced to make it general.

that constraint improves the system. not just for skill-play — for any skill in the tree.

---

## Tweet 7 — Pattern

content OS principle: the tools that document your work should be documented too.

GTM plays get screen recordings. skills get slash commands. same energy.

---

## Tweet 8 — System

run /skillplay voice-modularity. or play-draft. or any skill in .cursor/skills/.

file open or name provided. no screenshot gatekeeping. the skill file is the source.

---

## Tweet 9 — Invitation

structure matters more than specifics. grab the skill file, swap your skills, keep the angles.

system reveal. meta take. invitation. works for any skill share.

---

## Tweet 10 — CTA

skill file in the reply if you want to adapt it 👇

no gatekeeping. build your own content-from-skills loop.
