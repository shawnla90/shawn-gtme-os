## Tweet 1 — Hook

new thread. new agent. zero context.

you just lost everything you built in the last 2 hours.

---

## Tweet 2 — Context

I run multi-thread workflows. build work. content work. partner handoffs.

every time I switch or start fresh, the agent starts from zero. no partner context. no key files. no idea what's done vs what's next.

---

## Tweet 3 — Problem

re-explaining burns tokens. worse: the new agent guesses. wrong file, wrong assumption, wrong next step.

the context window reset is a hard boundary. you need a baton pass that actually works.

---

## Tweet 4 — Build

built a skill: agent-context-handoff.

you say full scope of this chat or handoff to new thread. it produces a markdown doc:
- partner and context
- what we accomplished
- key files (real paths)
- open questions
- next steps
- workflow hooks

---

## Tweet 5 — Results

paste into new chat. new agent reads it. knows exactly what to do. no prior conversation required.

standalone. token-efficient. actionable. file-anchored.

---

## Tweet 6 — Insight

the principle that unlocked it: file-anchored.

agents can read_file. they can't read vibes. give them paths, not descriptions. they execute.

---

## Tweet 7 — Pattern

handoffs aren't just human-to-human anymore. they're thread-to-thread. agent-to-agent. you-at-morning to you-at-midnight.

your systems should pass the baton cleanly.

---

## Tweet 8 — System

skills I use everyday, part 3 ⚡

the meta bit: this thread was written from a handoff doc. the handoff skill produced the scope. that scope got pasted into a new chat. the new agent wrote this.

the skill documented itself into existence.

---

## Tweet 9 — Invitation

steal the structure. partner, accomplishments, key files, open questions, next steps. adapt to your stack.

the framework matters more than my implementation. works in Cursor, Claude, custom GPTs, internal docs.

---

## Tweet 10 — CTA

full skill file and setup in the content OS. no gatekeeping. if you're building multi-thread or handoff workflows, grab the structure and make it yours.
