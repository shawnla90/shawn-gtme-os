## Hook Options for Tweet 1 (2–5 alternatives)

1. the biggest Cursor unlock I can give you: never start in agent mode.
2. I run 7 agents in parallel to build one feature. here's the trick nobody talks about.
3. plan mode is free. it reads your codebase. it maps the dependency graph. and it saves you from burning tokens on the wrong approach.
4. stop prompting harder. start planning first.

## Tweet 1 (Hook)

biggest Cursor unlock I can give you: never start in agent mode.

start in plan mode. every time.

yesterday I needed to add one feature across three websites. plan mode turned it into a 4-wave parallel execution plan.

7 agents. 8 tasks. zero wasted context. 🧵

## Tweet 2 (The Build / Context)

plan mode doesn't write code. it thinks.

it reads your codebase, maps what depends on what, and hands you a structured execution plan — what runs in parallel, what runs sequential, which models fit which tasks.

you see the full architecture before a single token is spent on code.

## Tweet 3 (The Substance)

my plan came back with 4 waves:

⚡ wave 1: data file + shared component (parallel)
🔧 wave 2: three site routes built simultaneously
🔗 wave 3: nav configs + backlinks (parallel)
✅ wave 4: build + verify (sequential)

each agent gets a scoped task. context stays clean. nothing collides.

## Tweet 4 (The Insight / Pattern)

the part nobody talks about: plan mode makes you better faster.

→ you learn execution order (what can parallelize)
→ you learn model selection (not everything needs the heaviest engine)
→ you learn your own codebase by reading how the plan decomposes it

the plan teaches you the architecture. the agents just execute it.

---

## Tweet 5 (CTA / Resource Delivery)

if you're using Cursor and haven't tried plan → parallel execute → verify:

open plan mode. describe the feature. don't ask it to build — ask it to plan the build.

then execute wave by wave in fresh agent chats.

biggest master unlock I can share. ⚡

## Notes

- Screenshot of the parallel agent execution plan attached to tweet 1
- Thread focuses on the "plan first, execute second" framework
- Tweet 3 is the meat — the actual wave structure with real data
- Tweet 4 is the insight — plan mode as a learning tool, not just an organizer
- Tweet 5 is actionable CTA — try this specific loop
- Aligns with the earlier cursor-tip-plan-mode micro-tip but goes much deeper
