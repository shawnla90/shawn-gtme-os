## Thread (7 tweets)

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**:
I had 17 tabs open and my laptop was frozen.

Instantly. HubSpot. Clay. Slack. Sheets. LinkedIn. Notion.

so I built something different. a modular operating system inside a code editor.

today I'm sharing the scaffold prompt + a full video walkthrough. thread 🧵

**Tweet 2 (The Problem)**:
the problem was never the tools.

every tool worked fine alone. the problem was the switching. every context switch = 5 minutes lost. every cross-tool data move = copy-paste. every "how did I set this up?" = digging through Slack.

tabs are not infrastructure.

**Tweet 3 (The Solution)**:
what if your repo was the operating system?

one repo. version controlled. MCP servers connecting every tool natively. your AI talks to your CRM. your content system talks to your outreach stack.

no more tabs. no more copy-pasting.

**Tweet 4 (What the Prompt Builds)**:
the scaffold prompt asks you 3 questions:
- your name/brand
- your platforms
- your tool stack

then it builds:
- 3-tier skill architecture
- content pipeline folders
- .gitignore (security layer)
- platform playbook starters
- README explaining the system

**Tweet 5 (MCP Guide)**:
it also includes an MCP connection guide by stack type:

GTM: Instantly, HeyReach, Firecrawl
Content: Typefully, Substack, Reddit
Both: GitHub, Browserbase, Slack

connect the tools you already use. add more as your system demands it.

**Tweet 6 (The Honest Part)**:
real talk: the scaffold gives you architecture. it doesn't give you skill.

I'm still learning this every day. mastery comes from building inside it. from writing voice files that are wrong. from skills that break. from commits you immediately want to change.

the prompt gives you a foundation. you build the rest.

**Tweet 7 (CTA)**:
the full scaffold prompt, MCP guide, security guide, AI slop checklist, 5 platform templates, and a video walkthrough of me building a repo from scratch are all in Monday's OS.AI Labs newsletter.

subscribe and it's yours. no gatekeeping.

## Notes

- Tweet 1 is the hook. If it doesn't stop the scroll, nothing else matters. Updated to mention the video walkthrough.
- Tweet 4 is the meat. The list format works well on X for scanability.
- Tweet 6 is what makes this thread real instead of a promo thread. The honesty is the differentiator.
- Tweet 7 is the only tweet with a link. Keeps reach intact on tweets 1-6. Updated to mention video.
- Consider posting tweet 1 standalone first to test the hook, then thread the rest in replies.
- Post this Monday (2026-02-17) to coincide with Post 3 dropping on Substack.
