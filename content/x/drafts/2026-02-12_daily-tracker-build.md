## Hook Options for Tweet 1 (5 alternatives)

1. I spent $7.75 on AI today. shipped 35 things. built a dashboard to prove it. ⚡
2. I didn't understand tokens. so I built a scoring system that grades my day.
3. 3.1M tokens. $7.75. 148 points. A+ grade. here's the dashboard I built to track it.
4. most builders have no idea what their AI costs per output. I built a fix.
5. every problem I have becomes a system. here's what happened when I didn't understand tokens.

## Tweet 1 (Hook)

I spent $7.75 on AI today. shipped 35 things. built a dashboard to prove it. ⚡

---

## Tweet 2 (Context)

I didn't understand tokens. so I did what I always do — built a system that forces me to learn by measuring it.

the daily tracker is a Cursor skill. Python + Pillow. one command generates a full scorecard.

---

## Tweet 3 (The Problem)

most builders have no idea what their AI actually costs per output.

they check a billing page once a month and hope for the best.

I was doing the same thing until I decided to fix it.

---

## Tweet 4 (The Build)

the tracker auto-scans git history, content folders, and token logs.

then it renders a dark-mode dashboard as a PNG.

accomplishments. pipeline. token usage. efficiency scoring. cost breakdowns. all in one image.

---

## Tweet 5 (The Results)

yesterday's scorecard:

35 shipped
31,605 words
3.1M tokens
$7.75 cost
19.08 pts/$ efficiency
A+ grade — 148 points

one PNG. the whole day receipted.

---

## Tweet 6 (The Insight)

the token breakdown changed how I route work.

Opus: $7.30 for deep builds.
Sonnet: $0.45 for quick scans.

once you see the split, you stop using the expensive model for lightweight tasks.

---

## Tweet 7 (The Pattern)

every time I don't understand something, I build a system that measures it.

Clay workflows. Cursor skills. content pipelines. token economics.

the loop is always the same: confusion → measurement → clarity → system → content.

---

## Tweet 8 (The System)

the tracker is one skill file in a repo of 40+.

it feeds into my content pipeline, my daily accountability, and now — this thread.

the tool became the workflow. the workflow became the post.

---

## Tweet 9 (The Invitation)

if you're building with AI daily and you don't know your cost per output, you're optimizing blind.

you don't need my exact system. build any version that gives you visibility.

the awareness alone changes your behavior.

---

## Tweet 10 (CTA)

building all of this in public. skills, plays, systems — shipping weekly.

follow along if you want the mess and the wins. ⚡

## Notes

**Screenshot reference**: data/daily-log/2026-02-12.png — attach to Tweet 1 to show the full dashboard.

**Key themes**: Builder learns by building, token economics visibility, systems-on-systems pattern, Cursor + Claude Code stack.

**Pillar rationale**: Building & Sharing — personal journey from not understanding tokens to building a visual accountability system. The pattern (problem → system → tool → content) is the thread's backbone.
