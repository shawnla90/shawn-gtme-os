## Tweet 1 (Hook)

built a slash command that syncs my entire partner Slack channel into structured markdown.

191 messages. 10 weeks. one command. ⚡

---

## Tweet 2 (The Connection)

it pulls every message, thread, and decision into categorized sections.

references. timeline. decisions. deliverables. next steps.

full operational context in one file.

---

## Tweet 3 (The Pattern)

most people prep for partner calls by scrolling Slack for 15 minutes.

I read a markdown file.

---

## Tweet 4 (The Stack)

the stack: Slack MCP + Cursor.

one skill file. reads the full channel history through Slack's API. outputs structured markdown to my partner's resource folder.

---

## Tweet 5 (The Output)

what one sync gives me:

→ 61 direct references
→ 14 key decisions
→ 28 deliverables tracked
→ 10 open items
→ full week-by-week timeline

---

## Tweet 6 (The Shift)

structured context changes how you operate.

you stop being reactive. you walk into calls knowing exactly where things stand.

no more "where did we land on that?"

---

## Tweet 7 (The Detail)

best part — it categorizes my messages by type.

status updates. asks. commitments. FYIs.

I can see exactly what I've promised and what's waiting on me.

---

## Tweet 8 (The Comparison)

without this: scroll slack. miss context. repeat conversations.

with this: full operational picture in 30 seconds.

infrastructure > memory.

---

## Tweet 9 (The Difference)

this isn't about having better tools.

it's about building habits that give you complete context on demand.

the best preparation isn't talent. it's systems.

---

## Tweet 10 (CTA)

building my own operating system inside a code editor.

every skill I build makes the next one easier.

follow along if you want the mess and the wins.

— shawn ⚡

## Notes

- Image shows Cursor terminal output from a completed /slacksync run for the <partner> partner channel
- Attach screenshot to Tweet 1 only
- Thread is 10 tweets — can trim to 8 by combining 6+7 and 8+9 if needed
- Each tweet stands alone for timeline readability
- Key theme: structured context enables proactive planning
