## Tweet 1 (Hook)

I'm screen recording myself creating this post. the play I'm showing is the system that creates the post. meta af.

---

## Tweet 2 (Context)

content operating system. cursor + claude + skill files. when I ship something, run /playdraft with a screenshot and context. the system outputs linkedin + x drafts before I close the tab.

---

## Tweet 3 (The Problem)

the old way: ship something cool → I'll write about it later → different app, different energy, moment's gone. content becomes a separate job from building.

---

## Tweet 4 (The Build)

the content OS flips it. the build IS the content context. cursor's open. claude's running. screenshot + pillar + enter. drafts in markdown. no handoff.

---

## Tweet 5 (The Results)

two linkedin posts. 20 tweets. straight into Typefully. all from I built this, here's the screenshot, go. completely modular — use what you want, post when you're ready. the amount of content I can produce has increased exponentially.

---

## Tweet 6 (The Insight)

dogfooding at the idea level. the system documents itself because it's already running when you need the documentation. not an afterthought. part of the loop.

---

## Tweet 7 (The Pattern)

your build environment should be your content environment. no gate between shipping and drafting. the moment you ship is the moment you draft.

---

## Tweet 8 (The System)

skill file loads voice DNA, pillar structure, formatting guides. human provides: what I built + which pillar. everything else is system. scales.

---

## Tweet 9 (The Invitation)

if you're building systems for GTM or content — make the system document itself. not I'll write about it. write WITH it. same context. same loop.

---

## Tweet 10 (CTA)

building this in public. follow if you want the mess and the wins. more plays coming.
