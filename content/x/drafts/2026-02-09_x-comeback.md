## Option A: Single Tweet

been building on LinkedIn for a year. 15 GTM plays documented. screen recordings. full prompts in the comments. no gatekeeping.

time to bring the plays here too ⚡

building GTM systems inside Cursor now. skill files, MCP servers, AI that reads my playbooks before writing anything.

follow along -- the plays, the builds, the system shares are coming here next.

## Option B: Short Thread (3 tweets)

### Tweet 1

been quiet here for a while.

wasn't quiet though. was building.

spent the last year on LinkedIn documenting GTM plays. 15 workflows. screen recordings. full prompts and formulas in the comments every time.

time to bring that energy here ⚡

### Tweet 2

what you'll see from me on here:

→ condensed plays (Clay, HubSpot, Instantly workflows)
→ Cursor build threads (AI-native GTM infrastructure)
→ system shares (skill files, operating systems, the stuff behind the content)
→ the occasional GTM meme because some things just need a gif

### Tweet 3

building GTM systems inside a code editor now. not kidding.

version-controlled playbooks. AI that reads my voice DNA before generating anything. MCP servers connecting to Slack, LinkedIn, email tools.

this is what GTM engineering looks like in 2026.

follow along if you're building too.

## Notes

- This post sets the identity for X. It's the anchor post that tells new followers what to expect.
- Option A is cleaner for a cold audience. Option B has more substance for engagement.
- Recommend Option B (thread) -- it gives more surface area for people to engage and RT individual tweets.
- No image needed, but could optionally attach the tree visualization to Tweet 1.
- Post this BEFORE or SAME DAY as the "What I Did Over This Weekend" thread. This sets context, that one delivers the goods.
