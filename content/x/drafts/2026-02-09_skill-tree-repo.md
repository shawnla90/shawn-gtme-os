## Tweet 1 (Hook)

this looks familiar.

Final Fantasy 10 skill tree.

i didn't know what building a repo was when i was building one.

i didn't know what building a skill tree looked like when i was grinding this game.

but the gamification is what immersed me.

## Tweet 2 (The Connection)

probably a hundred hours in the last seven days going cursor crazy.

on top of all the unlocks and continued XP, the fact is:

one of my key favorite parts about doing these skill trees and games was that once you acquire these skills, you really own them.

and you were able to repeat them.

---

## Tweet 3 (The Pattern)

that's exactly what you're doing with your go-to-market system.

or your content system.

or even an ad system.

you're building a skill tree.

every MCP server you add? that's a new ability unlocked.

every skill file you write? that's a node on your tree.

---

## Tweet 4 (The Gamification)

the gamification kept me going.

the unlocks. the XP. the progression.

didn't know what i was building. didn't know what it would look like when it was done.

but i kept grinding.

one skill file at a time. one MCP server at a time. one workflow at a time.

## Tweet 5 (The Ownership)

here's what clicked:

once you acquire these skills in the game, you own them.

you can repeat them.

you can use them in different combinations.

that's exactly what you're doing with your repo.

once you unlock those abilities, they're yours. forever.

---

## Tweet 6 (The Challenge)

it can be a little complicated.

but hey, if you were a gamer, this is all for you.

this is your moment. this is your chance.

any GTM engineer or STR who fears these more advanced tools should know:

either get in or get left behind.

## Tweet 7 (The RPG Connection)

at the same time, if you're somebody who's into anything that ever acquired playing an RPG game, this or Dungeons and Dragons, this is your way in.

i'm sure i'm not the only one who sees that.

the progression loop is the same.

unlock. acquire. repeat.

---

## Tweet 8 (The Non-Gamer Reality)

but again, if you're not a gamer, just realize:

if you're out there grabbing MD skills from every lead magnet post you see, just know you're basically the equivalent of grabbing new skins for an AK-47 in Call of Duty.

or being able to now double jump and fly into the air with a new skill.

you're collecting abilities. you're building your tree.

---

## Tweet 9 (The Difference)

the difference is:

in a game, the tree is pre-built.

in your repo, you're building it yourself.

you're the game designer. you're the player. you're both.

that's the power of building your own operating system.

## Tweet 10 (CTA)

this is just the start.

building in public = sharing the mess and the wins.

## Notes

- Image: Final Fantasy 10 skill tree screenshot (attach to first tweet)
- 10-tweet story arc that builds the narrative progressively
- Each tweet stands alone but builds on the previous
- Maintains lowercase opening, casual builder voice
- Key themes: gamification, skill ownership, GTM engineering, RPG connection
