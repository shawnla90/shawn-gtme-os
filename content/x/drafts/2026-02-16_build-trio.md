## X Build Post 2 — What's There

what's on shawnos.ai right now:

→ a blog running on markdown files
→ a daily build log with scored output and letter grades
→ an RPG progression system. 11 tiers. 5 classes.
→ a 280-line tracker prompt you can copy right now

all public. nothing gated.

## X Build Post 3 — The Arc

three weeks ago I had never registered a domain.

this weekend I deployed a three-site network from a Cursor terminal.

the system doesn't require you to already know everything. it requires you to learn the next skill.
