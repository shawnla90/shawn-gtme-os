your content workflow is browser tabs. mine is infrastructure.

26 skills. 6 platforms. 1 repo. 0 copy-paste.

here's the content OS master plan ⚡

the standard AI content workflow in 2026:

→ open ChatGPT
→ paste a prompt
→ copy the output
→ open another tab
→ paste a different prompt
→ hope the voice matches

that's not a system. that's a scavenger hunt.

=== TWEET 3 ===

what I built instead:

a git repo with two operating systems.

GTM OS → runs pipeline (Clay, HeyReach, Instantly)
Content OS → runs distribution (LinkedIn, X, Substack, Reddit, TikTok, YouTube)

same codebase. they feed each other.

the secret ingredient is the voice DNA.

4 files that every skill reads before it writes anything:

→ core-voice.md (my tone, patterns, identity)
→ viral-hooks.md (scroll-stopping openers)
→ anti-slop.md (29 AI patterns to catch)
→ safety-filters.md (name protection)

my voice isn't a vibe. it's versioned.

the skills engine is where the work happens.

26 active Cursor skills. each one a specialized pipeline:

/playdraft → screenshot to content
/finalcopy → draft to publish-ready
/substackpost → topic to newsletter
/xtip → idea to micro-tip
/tiktokscript → concept to storyboard

one slash command. done.

each platform has its own playbook.

LinkedIn → long-form, builder narrative, 1000+ chars
X → compressed, punchy, standalone tweets
Substack → breathing room, deeper thinking
Reddit → SEO, community credibility
TikTok → 16-second hooks

same voice. different compression. the skills know which rules to follow.

here's the flywheel:

GTM OS runs campaigns → campaigns generate stories
Content OS documents stories → stories build audience
Audience feeds pipeline → pipeline feeds campaigns

the two systems create a loop. content isn't a task. it's infrastructure that compounds.

what's running right now:

→ 36 active drafts across all platforms
→ 11+ LinkedIn drafts queued
→ 12+ X drafts queued
→ 4 Substack posts in pipeline
→ daily tracker auto-detects all of it from git

no content calendar. no Notion board. auto-detected from commits.

=== TWEET 9 ===

things I no longer do:

→ paste prompts into ChatGPT tabs
→ manually format for each platform
→ copy content between browser windows
→ hope my voice stays consistent
→ track drafts in a spreadsheet

the repo handles all of it. versioned. tracked. consistent.

=== TWEET 10 ===

building this in public.

the GTM plays. the content skills. the voice system. the daily output.

follow along if you want to see what happens when a GTM engineer builds their own content infrastructure.

more coming. no gatekeeping ⚡
