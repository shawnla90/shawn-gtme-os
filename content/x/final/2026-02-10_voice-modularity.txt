just updated my voice rules in the middle of writing this post. saw something I didn't like, edited the skill file. next draft had it. that's the loop.

content operating system. voice DNA in markdown. core-voice.md, x-twitter.md, linkedin.md. when something feels off — too many I's, quotes that feel stiff — open the file. change it. the change flows through.

the old way: hand AI a style guide, hope it remembers. write something, see a pattern you hate, shrug. no way to fix it without rewriting the whole prompt.

=== TWEET 4 ===
the content OS flips it. voice rules are files. you're in the loop. cursor open, skill loaded, you generate. you react. you edit the source. next output already has the fix.

=== TWEET 5 ===
modular. take things out, put things in. no quotes. capitalize I. don't overuse I. each preference lives in a file. change the file, change every draft. no retraining.

=== TWEET 6 ===
I'm not talking about AI writing for you. I'm talking about having it write WITH you. same context. same tab. you refine as you go. the system learns in real-time because you're editing the source.

=== TWEET 7 ===
the best way to craft your voice isn't to tell a ghostwriter what you want. it's to build a system that sits next to you. you write. it generates. you see something off. you fix the rule. it generates again.

=== TWEET 8 ===
skill file loads voice DNA. human provides: what to write about. everything else — structure, formatting, anti-patterns — lives in the file tree. editable. visible. versions with you.

=== TWEET 9 ===
if you're building content systems — make the voice rules editable. not buried in prompts. in markdown. so when you see something you don't like, you can change it. that's how voice actually gets refined.

=== TWEET 10 ===
building this in public. the meta loop: update a skill, post about the update, do it again. follow if you want the system and the receipts.
