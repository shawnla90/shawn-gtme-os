built a slash command that syncs my entire partner Slack channel into structured markdown.

191 messages. 10 weeks. one command. ⚡

=== TWEET 2 ===
it pulls every message, thread, and decision into categorized sections.

references. timeline. decisions. deliverables. next steps.

full operational context in one file.

=== TWEET 3 ===
most people prep for partner calls by scrolling Slack for 15 minutes.

I read a markdown file.

=== TWEET 4 ===
the stack: Slack MCP + Cursor.

one skill file. reads the full channel history through Slack's API. outputs structured markdown to my partner's resource folder.

=== TWEET 5 ===
what one sync gives me:

→ 61 direct references
→ 14 key decisions
→ 28 deliverables tracked
→ 10 open items
→ full week-by-week timeline

=== TWEET 6 ===
structured context changes how you operate.

you stop being reactive. you walk into calls knowing exactly where things stand.

no more "where did we land on that?"

=== TWEET 7 ===
best part — it categorizes my messages by type.

status updates. asks. commitments. FYIs.

I can see exactly what I've promised and what's waiting on me.

=== TWEET 8 ===
without this: scroll slack. miss context. repeat conversations.

with this: full operational picture in 30 seconds.

infrastructure > memory.

=== TWEET 9 ===
this isn't about having better tools.

it's about building habits that give you complete context on demand.

the best preparation isn't talent. it's systems.

=== TWEET 10 ===
building my own operating system inside a code editor.

every skill I build makes the next one easier.

follow along if you want the mess and the wins.
