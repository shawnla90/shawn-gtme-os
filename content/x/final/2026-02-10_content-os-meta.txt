I'm screen recording myself creating this post. the play I'm showing is the system that creates the post. meta af.

=== TWEET 2 ===
content operating system. cursor + claude + skill files. when I ship something, run /playdraft with a screenshot and context. the system outputs linkedin + x drafts before I close the tab.

=== TWEET 3 ===
the old way: ship something cool → I'll write about it later → different app, different energy, moment's gone. content becomes a separate job from building.

=== TWEET 4 ===
the content OS flips it. the build IS the content context. cursor's open. claude's running. screenshot + pillar + enter. drafts in markdown. no handoff.

=== TWEET 5 ===
two linkedin posts. 20 tweets. straight into Typefully. all from I built this, here's the screenshot, go. completely modular — use what you want, post when you're ready. the amount of content I can produce has increased exponentially.

=== TWEET 6 ===
dogfooding at the idea level. the system documents itself because it's already running when you need the documentation. not an afterthought. part of the loop.

=== TWEET 7 ===
your build environment should be your content environment. no gate between shipping and drafting. the moment you ship is the moment you draft.

=== TWEET 8 ===
skill file loads voice DNA, pillar structure, formatting guides. human provides: what I built + which pillar. everything else is system. scales.

=== TWEET 9 ===
if you're building systems for GTM or content — make the system document itself. not I'll write about it. write WITH it. same context. same loop.

=== TWEET 10 ===
building this in public. follow if you want the mess and the wins. more plays coming.
