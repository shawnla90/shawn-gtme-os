# X (Twitter) Content Queue

Content drafts for X posts. Each file is a standalone post or thread ready to copy-paste into X.

## File Naming

```
YYYY-MM-DD_slug.md
```

Example: `2026-02-09_weekend-build.md`

## Workflow

1. Draft goes in `drafts/`
2. Run through pre-publish checklist (`skills/tier-3-content-ops/pre-publish-checklist.md`)
3. Copy-paste into X
4. Move to `published/` after posting (or delete -- git history has it)

## Format

Each draft file contains:
- **Frontmatter**: platform, pillar, status, date
- **Post body**: ready to paste (character-count aware)
- **Thread tweets**: separated by `---` if it's a thread
- **Image notes**: references to any attached images

## Voice Reference

See `skills/tier-2-context-playbooks/x-twitter.md` for X-specific voice and formatting rules.
