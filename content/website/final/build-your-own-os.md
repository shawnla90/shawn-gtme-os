## the toolkit

I built a modular GTM operating system inside Cursor and Claude Code. a repo where content pipelines, outreach automation, CRM connections, and daily operations all live in one place. I've been writing about the journey. the identity shift from tool user to system builder. the 17 tabs. the frozen laptop. the moment a code editor stopped being a code editor and became an operating system.

today you get the toolkit.

## the actual problem

I had 17 tabs open. Instantly in one. HubSpot in another. Clay. Slack. Google Sheets. LinkedIn. A Notion doc I hadn't updated in three weeks. my laptop was frozen. not slow. frozen. and I was supposed to be the guy building efficient GTM systems.

the real problem wasn't the tools. every tool was fine on its own. the problem was the switching. every time I jumped between contexts, I lost 5 minutes re-orienting. every time I needed data from one tool inside another, I copy-pasted. every time I wanted to remember how I set something up last month, I searched through old Slack messages.

this is the reality most GTM and content people live in. and it's a solvable architecture problem. not a productivity habits problem.

you need a better system.

## what changed

I learned Cursor. then I learned Claude Code. and then I discovered MCPs.

Model Context Protocol means your AI tools talk to your other tools natively. your code editor talks to your CRM. your content system talks to your outreach stack. suddenly the repo isn't just where code lives. it's the operating system that connects everything.

I've written about what I built, why the system matters more than any single tool, and how I found the environment. this post gives you the starting point to build your own.

## what I'm giving you

I put together a scaffold package. it's not my repo. it's the prompt and the templates to build yours.

here's what's in it:

**the scaffold prompt.** one prompt you paste into Claude Code or Cursor. it asks you 3 questions. your name, your platforms, your tool stack. then it builds the entire directory structure. the 3-tier skill architecture. the content pipeline folders. the .gitignore. the README. everything scaffolded and ready to fill in.

**platform playbook starters.** lite templates for X, Reddit, TikTok, and YouTube. they give you the structure, the content formats, the cross-posting rules, and the platform-specific guidelines. you fill in your voice, your tone, your patterns.

**an AI slop detection checklist.** 6 of the most common patterns that make AI-assisted content sound like a language model instead of you. em-dashes, authority signaling, dramatic framing, bookend summaries, humble brag disclaimers. run it on every draft.

**an MCP connection guide.** which MCPs to connect based on your stack type. if you're GTM and outbound: Instantly, HeyReach, Firecrawl. if you're content and creator: Typefully, Substack, Reddit. if you're both: GitHub, Browserbase, Slack. each one with what it does and why you'd connect it.

**a security layer guide.** how to set up your .gitignore properly. what to protect vs. what to share. environment variables, folder-level security, pre-push checklists. this part matters more than people think.

## the video

I recorded myself running the scaffold prompt from scratch. empty folder. one prompt. 3 questions. watch the whole thing get built in real time.

you'll see exactly what gets generated, how the output is structured, and what the file tree looks like when it's done. if you're the kind of person who wants to see it before you try it, this is your walkthrough.

## what this is not

this scaffold gives you the architecture. it does not give you the skill.

if you think you're going to paste one prompt, run it, and become a Cursor power user overnight... it doesn't work that way. I'm still learning this every day. I've burned entire afternoons debugging things that should have taken 20 minutes. I've accidentally staged client data for a commit. I've written skills that broke three other skills.

the scaffold gives you somewhere to put things. the mastery comes from using it. from building your first skill and watching it fail. from pushing your first commit and then immediately seeing something you need to change.

this is a long game. the prompt gives you a foundation. you build the rest by doing the work.

## get the full package

the scaffold prompt, the MCP guide, the security guide, and all 5 platform templates are available on the [OS.AI Labs newsletter](https://shawntenam.substack.com). everything is in markdown. copy what you need. paste the prompt into Claude Code or Cursor. answer the 3 questions. start building.

## what's next

a deep dive into one of the Cursor skills that runs my daily content pipeline. the one that turns a screenshot into 3 LinkedIn drafts and a 10-post X thread in under a minute. I'll break down the full skill file and show you how to build your own.

the lab is open. let's build.
