This is post zero. It's also a markdown file sitting in a monorepo. The same monorepo that runs content pipelines, outreach campaigns, operations, and the deployment stack for three websites.

You can read this post. Or you can look at the system that shipped it. Both paths lead to the same place.

### Start with what you can see

The site you're on right now runs on Next.js, deployed through Vercel, managed inside a Turborepo monorepo. It shares a design system with two other sites. Same codebase, different accent colors, one push deploys all three.

The blog engine renders markdown files. This post is one of those files. The content pipeline that drafted it uses the same voice system and the same AI agents that draft LinkedIn posts, Substack newsletters, and campaign copy.

Everything connects. That's not a tagline. That's the file structure.

### Now look a layer deeper

There's a daily build log on this site. It doesn't just list what happened. It scores it. Every day gets an output score, a letter grade, and a Class Avatar based on what actually shipped. Not what was planned. What shipped.

The scoring engine tracks commits, content output, and operational work. It rolls those into a number. The number determines the grade. The grade determines the title. The title shows up on the avatar badge on the landing page you came from.

11 tiers. 5 class specializations. Titles that change when output changes. There's a whole progression system behind it, and a skill guide that explains how every piece works.

I'm telling you it exists. I'm not going to explain all of it here. Go look.

### The thing underneath the thing

What's actually here is a system that happens to have a URL now. The content pipelines were running before the site existed. The outreach automation was running. The daily logs were running. The agents were drafting and deploying.

The site is just the system pointing at itself for the first time and saying: go look.

And here's what makes it worth mentioning: this whole thing was built by someone who had never setup up a dns or new what vercel deploy meant two weeks ago. No CS degree. Just a willingness to learn the next skill, and the next one, and to not stop when the plan got bigger than expected.

One website turned into three. The blog engine turned into a log system. The log system turned into a scoring engine. The scoring engine turned into an RPG style progression. Each piece built on the last. That's how compounding works when you let it.

This isn't vibe coding. This isn't "hey chat, build me a website." This is "I want to build a website. So I should understand how websites work. And monorepos. And DNS. And deployment pipelines. And design systems."

The learning is the system. The system is the proof.

### Who built this

Shawn. The about page has the full arc. But the system is the resume. The log is the receipt. There's more to see than this one post.

go poke around.
