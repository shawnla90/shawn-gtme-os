This is post zero.

Not a manifesto. Not a mission statement. Just the first commit on what happens when you stop treating go-to-market like a department and start treating it like an engineering problem.

### The short version

I'm Shawn. I spent years in sales — SDR, AE, the whole ladder. Somewhere along the way I stopped following playbooks and started building them. Then I stopped building playbooks and started building *systems*.

The system I run today lives in a single repo. It handles:

- **Content** — LinkedIn, X, Substack, all drafted and finalized from markdown
- **Outreach** — Clay enrichment, Instantly campaigns, HeyReach sequences
- **Operations** — partner onboarding, Slack syncs, pipeline tracking
- **Deployment** — Vercel, Turborepo, Next.js across a three-site network

All of it orchestrated through Cursor with AI agents that know the codebase, the voice, and the workflow.

### Why build in public

Because the best proof of concept is the one people can watch you build.

Every post on this site is generated from the same system that runs the GTM ops. The blog engine, the markdown pipeline, the deploy — it's all one graph. If something ships here, it shipped through the OS.

### What comes next

More posts. More builds. More transparency about what a one-person GTM engineering stack actually looks like when it's running at full speed.
